", "aSentId": 28928, "answer": "I can happily try and explain this to you since just like you many people don't explain things in detail and just bait the headlines. \n\nUSB Type-C is simply a connector and cable. Type-C cable and connector are capable of data transfer up to 10 Gbps (still inferior to Thunderbolt and that is why Thunderbolt will not die from this), power delivery detailed by the USB Power Delivery 2.0 spec allowing up to 5 amperage at 20V or 100w, and has active support for DisplayPort 1.2a and 1.3. DisplaysPort 1.2a and 1.3 are detailed as 4k at 60hz and 5k monitors, respectively. These can all be achieved at the same time thanks to USB 3.1 standards, not Type-C. \n\nAs it pertains to monitors, VESA has detailed this. USB 3.1 is able to deliver 100w, more than most monitors. If I remember correctly, 4k@60Hz monitors go up to 75w depending on the manufacture. Assuming that you have a PC with a PCI-e lane that is 2.0 and above, that grants 125w. You could by an add-on card that has USB 3.1 Type-C ports on it. With that you could essentially power your monitor with one plug directly from your PC through the Type-C port as long as you have enough headroom on your PSU to allow that. Example: my old rig had a 1250w PSU but my rig only would draw 850w from it. With a 4k@60Hz that draw up to (let's say 75w) I could easily get 4 monitors with only 4 cables that plug directly into my PC. \n\nAnother reason that USB 3.1 Type-C is able to do this is due to VESA specifications stating that atleast 8.1 Gpbs are required for 4k@60Hz. That is 8.1 of the total 10 Gbps that USB 3.1 is capable of. \n\nAs for reaching refresh rates above 60Hz, I would assume that it would be able since 1080p@144Hz requires only a standard DisplayPort. \n\nHope this helps and if you have any more question go ahead and ask.

It's not for everyone!   Never was meant to be.  People that argue about their iphone vs. this or their android vs. this, are missing the point.   This device was built because there is a gap to be filled.   The big problem is that the Pioneer is always remembered, but seldom lives.   You really never want to be the first - the first gets killed.   Improving on the first is the way to go.\n\n2.  Like it or not, there is a resurgence of the need for better sounding music, interestingly enough - a resurgence of just getting back to the way things sounded prior to MP3s.  There is in many ways a \"new\" revival of things not just in music...going back to how it was 10 years ago.   There are some things right now, that are hurt by tech.  They will get better as the tech gets better, but right now the compromise is too great.\n\n3.  MP3s are somewhat limited but can still sound good THROUGH A GOOD PLAYER.  no.  your iphone or android device aren't good players.  They're not.  They are a compromise.  There's nothing wrong with that, they do a million other things - some of those things fairly well, but it does need to be recognized.  I'm sure this will get people all irate, but it's true.  Oh, and laptops?  they sound terrible.  Get a DAC/AMP plug it in and you'll realize what you are missing.  I've converted far too many people in my office.  It's not audiophile snake oil - it's the truth.\n\n4.  Once you have good components in the full chain, you can realize what you are missing.  Once you know what you are missing, it's very hard to go backwards though.\n\n5.  \"Casual Listening\" doesn't mean I suddenly accept things that sound bad because it's casual.  If it sounds bad, it sounds bad - regardless of being in the gym or being at home or being in the car.  Hearing a song I love through a really mediocre player makes me wonder how i ever loved that song to begin with.   Hearing that same song again on a great player, with great headphones or speakers makes me then say \"oh...that's why I loved it!\" \n\n6.  Some car setups sound incredible - my car setup which is, elaborate, absolutely sound's better than 99% of most people's home equipment or portables.  I absolutely can tell the difference in MP3 quality, and so can everyone who's ever been in my car.\n\n7.  Music for some isn't about filling the gaps of silence, about occupying the brain for a bit, a distraction.   Music for some is something that brings a sense of joy to their world.   When you hear a favorite song through a great system, you experience something that you can't put your finger on, you hear something that has an intangible greatness to it, it has that much more life to it.  It reveals itself as poetry.    As someone said while in my car \"I know what you spent, and I want to say that you are insane, but I can't stop smiling while listening to this.\"\n\n8.  Given a choice between carrying every MP3 I have or having better sound, I'll pick better sound every time.   \"MP3 more storage = better player\", is the same falsehood in cameras of  \"More Megapixels = better camera\"\n\n\nIf you can bring this kind of joy to yourself in an easy way, why not?   And once you experience it, you will then sacrifice some of your \"needs\" of features or convenience, because the joy outweighs those needs.    I'll carry 1 extra device with me if it means that I can have that kind of simple pleasure during my commute or travel.   \n\n\n\n\n\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qgzt", "qSentId": 29254, "question": "Make your bike a \"Smart Bike\"", "aSentId": 29255, "answer": "It dosent have brakes.

What the USB dongle is doing is using a series of charge pumps to drive up voltage much higher than typical voltages for an IO device. It then tries to discharge it to the IO device. Rinse and repeat. It's actually not hard to design for any EE201 student. \n\nESD protection works by using a diode/clamp (or ground gate MOS, which is just a fancy diode) structure to guard the input device. However, many clamps are designed to have fast time constants as ESD events are fast, much faster than a hot plugging event (like inserting an USB key). Most likely, the ESD circuit will not be able to respond to this type of attack.\n\nAlso, because of the relatively small capacitances involved, this type of ESD would be considered machine model ESD (rather than human body model). Most electronics are rated for 100-200V machine model ESD at best. \n\nPlus, you don't necessarily want the ESD circuits to trigger.

If you read the source, or even the Hackaday article on it, you can see Dark Purple specifically designed it to get around the ESD protection:\n\n&gt;While any electrical port on a computer is a great entry point for potentially hazardous signals, USB is pretty well protected. If you short power and ground together, the port simply shuts off. Pass through a few kV of static electricity and TVS diodes safely shunt the power. Feed in an RF signal and the inline filtering beads dissipate most of the energy.\n\n&gt;To get around or break through these protections, [Dark Purple]\u2019s design uses an inverting DC-DC converter. The converter takes power from the USB port to charge a capacitor bank up to -110VDC. After the caps are charged, the converter shuts down and a transistor shunts the capacitor voltage to the data pins of the port. Once the caps are discharged, the supply fires back up and the cycle repeats until the computer is fried (typically as long as bus voltage is present). The combination of high voltage and high current is enough to defeat the small TVS diodes on the bus lines and successfully fry some sensitive components\u2014and often the CPU. USB is typically integrated with the CPU in most modern laptops, which makes this attack very effective.\n\n[Hackaday source](http://hackaday.com/2015/03/11/killer-usb-drive-is-designed-to-fry-laptops/#comment-2476438)\n\nI see Dark Purple in the comments around there from time to time, so if you want, you can just ask him yourself.

DRAMs are the main memory chips used to store data while the system is running. Virtually everybody, including experts, will tell you that DRAM contents are lost when you turn off the power. But this isn\u2019t so. Our research shows that data in DRAM actually fades out gradually over a period of seconds to minutes, enabling an attacker to read the full contents of memory by cutting power and then rebooting into a malicious operating system.\n\n&gt; Interestingly, if you cool the DRAM chips, for example by spraying inverted cans of \u201ccanned air\u201d dusting spray on them, the chips will retain their contents for much longer. At these temperatures (around -50 \u00b0C) you can remove the chips from the computer and let them sit on the table for ten minutes or more, without appreciable loss of data. Cool the chips in liquid nitrogen (-196 \u00b0C) and they hold their state for hours at least, without any power.

Due to the nature of the compounds, the strength of each, needs to remain stable and the shelf life of each compound the machine would fill up your entire living room.  This robot's purpose is the rapidly make flavors (same stuff as smells save the taste compounds like sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami).  It takes the machine about 20 mins to generate a flavor.\n\nI have seen a smaller model device from anther company that requires the user to load samples of pre-made flavors into it and it can mix a few together to make novel combinations.  The cost to maintain this device is REALLY expensive as flavor compounds are not cheap.  A good quality identifiable flavor will cost anywhere in the ball park of 20-50 dollars a kilogram and with markup it would make inkjet printer ink look like a good idea to wash your car with.  Add to that the volatile compounds most appealing tend to evaporate under normal conditions and even with controls I do not keep them in neat (pure) or compounded more than 6 months.  So replacement would be often AND expensive.   Sorry, this is novel but not practical in the least.", "aSentId": 30906, "answer": "And I think what really drives this home, based on what you're describing, is all this would be required simply to smell *food*. I get the feeling these flavor compounds don't include stuff like blood, vomit, shit, garbage, grease, vehicle exhaust, flowers, etc. etc.\n\nI think the only effective way ever of simulating smell will be with direct brain stimulation, not chemical stimulation of the nose. Even then, it'll require an enormous database of information, but at least shelf-life isn't a concern, and you don't need a separate copy of that information for every person.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qgzt", "qSentId": 30907, "question": "And I think what really drives this home, based on what you're describing, is all this would be required simply to smell *food*.
