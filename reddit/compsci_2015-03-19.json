No, you still require O(n).\n\nFor example dynamic array: \"Insertion or removal of elements at the end - **amortized** constant O(1)\". For 1 insertion it may trigger reallocation of the whole array, so yes it's O(n) for 1 insertion. But for n insertions it still requires O(n), not O(n^2 ). Assume you insert  9 elements into an empty array, when the array is full, you reallocate it, double its size. So the cost are: \n\n1. 1 (1/1)\n1. 2 (realloc 1 element) (2/2)\n1. 3 (realloc 2 element) (3/4)\n1. 1 (4/4)\n1. 5 (realloc 4 elements) (5/8)\n1. 1 (6/8)\n1. 1 (7/8)\n1. 1 (8/8)\n1. 9 (realloc 8 elements) (9/16)\n\nThe total cost for 9 insertions is 9 + (1 + 2 + 4 + 8) = 24.\n\nYou may generalize it for n insertions, where n = 2^k + 1:\n\nn + (1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^k )  \n= n + (2^k+1 - 1) / (2 - 1)  \n= n + 2 * 2^k - 1.  \nBut n = 2^k + 1, so 2^k = n - 1, so our total cost are  \nn + 2(n - 1) - 1  \n= 3n - 3.  \nSo for n insertions it requires only O(n), not O(n^2 ).
