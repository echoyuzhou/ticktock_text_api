The rules are in the Defense's favor so most of the time the D dominates the game. This video is more an example of bad defense than an \"intense Rugby try\". A lot of times you get outnumbered and cornered. Your guys can't block. The defense always has a a clear line to the ball carrier all the time. Whether they come after you or not is up to them. Some times they'll let you attack them, because you're putting distance between you and your team. If you get deserted and have no one to pass to, you're SOL. You basically have to kick it deep (if you have space) or hurl the ball backwards across the field (which isn't safe). If your team has \"advantage\" (the other team has a penalty waiting), you can kick it out of bounds and still have an opportunity to throw it back in. Otherwise, you have to eat it, get tackled and fight for the ball long enough for your teammates to come help. (some leagues make you give it up, I believe). Offense has more variables. Passing, catching, teammates in position, thinking ahead, etc. They all have to go right all the time. Also a bad turnover can turn into an easy try for the other team so you have to be cautious of your surroundings. It is a defense dominate game and that's what makes it interesting. Then again both sides are also walking a tight rope at all times because one wrong move can be an easy try for the other team.\n\nEDIT: It's funny you said the 10/10 versus 9/10 thing, because when my uncle got me started playing Rugby I told him that's what I love about it. All American sports, especially basketball (maybe not baseball), seem to give the offense so many opportunities. I think Rugby is more similar to basketball than anything. It's just played on a giant court, you can't pass forward and no one is protecting your precious body. Using basketball as an example specifically, the defense is hindered by fouls and the referees' control of the game. It's like the team that successfully completes the most opportunities wins the game rather than the team that plays the best all around. That's also why I believe in tie games. If you didn't win in the given time of a game, then you didn't win. Just because you capitalized on 1 more extra opportunity that was GIVEN to you doesn't mean you won. Might as well toss a coin. On that note, the NFL overtime rules are the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. I still can't believe that people agree it is fair.
