The writer, regretfully, has made three important errors in an otherwise reasonable set of requests.\n\nFirstly, Unicode hasn't \"started\" Han Unification.  Unicode started with the idea that all characters could be encoded in 2 bytes -- meaning, up to about 64k of them.  The only way to accomplish this was to do the Han Unification.  \n\nAs it turns out, that was a mistake.  The goal of each character taking just one code point had to be dropped; there were too many \"combination\" characters, so that writing programs need to handle characters with different numbers of bytes anyway.  Technologies like UTF8 (which didn't exist when Unicode was created) have lessened the value of a strict 2-bytes-per-character encoding.\n\nSecondly, the writer does have to type too much to write a simple name.  But that's the fault of the keyboard, not Unicode.  Unicode has no trouble representing the name correctly.  It's just that the keyboard maker (a soft keyboard, so it's really just a program) didn't bother making it simple to type.\n\nLastly, the way to add new characters to Unicode is to add them: the rules for new characters are simple, and any reasonably capable organization can do it.  What the writer complains about -- the fact that seemingly silly characters like linear-A and person-relishing-delicious-food are added while important characters are not -- is caused by the organization not picking and choosing \"winners\" and deciding what to work on.  Instead, the contributors decide what's important.  It turns out that linear A had some champions willing to clearly define the characters, describe them, create a sample font, and do the paperwork to show that the characters are used.  It would seem either than Bengali does not (which seems unlikely) or that the writer simply doesn't see the updates to Bengali.  According to Wikipedia, each of the recent updates to Unicode have included more Bengali characters.\n\n(BTW -- it looks like the han unification problems were averted with the conversion of IISCI into Unicode)\n", "aSentId": 18742, "answer": "Yeah this entire article strikes me as a bunch of pointless whining.

I will add that I dont think is a good idea to change everything in that break in computers. But small concessions can go a big way.", "aSentId": 19193, "answer": "Most of this stuff is done out of necessity. I can go into further detail with Persian because it's an interesting and illustrative case.\n\nPersian script is based on Arabic script, which is generally well supported on computerized systems. I can read and write Persian in its original script on Linux, Android, Windows, Mac OS... heck, even Windows Phone. However, sometimes it just doesn't work. Sometimes I message friends on older devices like pre-4.0 Android (Persian support wasn't completed on Android until 3.1, which was only for tablets). Also, some applications have the Unicode AND fonts in place (like terminal emulators), but just don't do right-to-left text display. In fact, RTL is still a huge problem in a lot of areas, like when you want to mix Latin and Arabic based text in a single line. Sometimes the line is messed up completely.\n\nThe practical result is that most Persian speakers are already accustomed to reading and writing their language with Latin characters, BUT they are set on the idea that this is a lower form of writing and therefore are not good at standardizing it or adopting a new alphabet. This is where middle ground can be found, because rather than awkwardly spelling words with only English letters, we can add things like A + macron and basically be on par with many European alphabets. The support for these extra Latin characters is much better established on computer systems, to the point where I'm certain that there are enough Latin-derived characters in any modern font to accommodate all the languages of the world.\n\nI even have to Latinize Tajik sometimes. Tajik is a dialect of Persian written in Cyrillic. You'd think it would be just as easy to type Cyrillic on a modern system as Latin, right? Wrong. One of the problems is that the Russians are basically Nazis about their alphabet. The Android Russian keyboard has NO diacritical marks available for Russian letters. This is typical of Russian systems, and also Soviet administration--non-Russian languages that were written in Cyrllic had their own letters, but in practicality they were often forced to mangle their words by writing in only letters that Russians used or could pronounce. So on all systems I can type \u0447, but I can't type \u04b7. But even very old computer systems support at least \"US International\" keyboard layout, which is the Latin character set plus a bunch of diacritical marks.\n\nSo really, if we search for a compromise that suits both practicality and linguistic requirements, we can go ahead and Latinize. However, once you throw national pride into the mix, the compromise fails. Likewise, the need to preserve/digitize older texts is an important and worthy cause, although it's not as pressing of a day-to-day need as communication *now*, and it can be relegated to more specialized systems instead of universalizing them.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2fwo", "qSentId": 19196, "question": "\"The Father of Visual Basic\"", "aSentId": 19197, "answer": "&gt; The team consisted of Mark Merker, Gary Kratkin, Mike Geary and Frank Raab.

The answer depends on the compiler, but since (almost) everyone uses GHC, we can find the `returnIO` and `bindIO` in `GHC.Base`.

You can remove the `Monad` typeclass from the language and you still have `IO` and everything to use it.\n\nFor example, one can use the `Applicative IO` instance to sequence some actions:\n\n    main :: IO ()\n    main = putStr \"Hello, \" *&gt; putStrLn \"World!\"\n\nThe only connection between monads and side effects is this `Monad IO` instance, that's it.

But those functions are generic, they work with any `Monad`, just like `fmap` works with any `Functor`. Do we have monomorphic versions, that work on `IO` only? The answer depends on the compiler, but since (almost) everyone uses GHC, we can find the `returnIO` and `bindIO` in `GHC.Base`. You can read the source and see for yourself that the `Monad IO` instance is defined as follows:\n\n    instance  Monad IO  where\n        {-# INLINE return #-}\n        {-# INLINE (&gt;&gt;)   #-}\n        {-# INLINE (&gt;&gt;=)  #-}\n        m &gt;&gt; k    = m &gt;&gt;= \\ _ -&gt; k\n        return    = returnIO\n        (&gt;&gt;=)     = bindIO\n        fail s    = failIO s\n\njust like the `Functor []`:\n\n    instance Functor [] where\n        {-# INLINE fmap #-}\n        fmap = map\n\nYou don't need to use the generalized monadic operations to work with `IO`, you can resort to monomorphic `returnIO` and `bindIO` and do everything you were doing. You can remove the `Monad` typeclass from the language and you still have `IO` and everything to use it.\n\nFor example, one can use the `Applicative IO` instance to sequence some actions:\n\n    main :: IO ()\n    main = putStr \"Hello, \" *&gt; putStrLn \"World!\"\n\nThe only connection between monads and side effects is this `Monad IO` instance, that's it. So consider this quote by /u/eras:\n\n&gt; If you use monads to do it, you are already ascending to the side-effectful world\n\nThat's absolutely not true.

Guaranteed software freedom. Access to the code guaranteed! I have no doubt that the FSF, RMS, and the GNU Manifesto will be remembered for the incredible effect they have had on software.\n\nIt's funny. You know the idea but you don't quite grok it until you need it. The first time I modified a program it was to make it run on my crappy Via graphics processor. I was a kid and I didn't know anything, but the program crashed saying it couldn't allocate a specific chunk of memory for a texture[1]. I had the source code for this game and found the line and (I don't recall this bit very much) changed the size of some array. \n\nImagine my surprise when I recompiled it and it ran! One edge of the background behind the menu would smear off to the right, but I could get in the actual game just fine. Turns out the problem was only on the menu. \n\nThis was amazing! I didn't have to tell someone to fix it for my very specifically crappy card. Even though I learnt very little and knew nothing, I'd managed to get the game running. And who would even fix it if the fix just corrupted the menu for everyone else?\n\nI lacked any expertise at the time. But I could do this! I became a fan of the idea for life.\n\n1: Was it X with BadAlloc? I don't remember.
