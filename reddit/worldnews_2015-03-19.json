The protesters did go to the presidential palace, because the whole purpose of a protest is to make those in power feel uncomfortable and do what people want from them. The scorched doors were a controversial point: there were attempts to stop them by protesters, but the police prevented this from happening. Was it confusion? Was there conspiracy? It wouldn't be the craziest thing to happen in Mexican (or world) politics.\n\nMexico is a funny country, we were able to depose of a de-facto 90 year old dictatorship hidden as a democratic government without a revolution. It's well understood that democracy is not something a government respects, but something that is imposed by the citizens on governments. People are panicking because they think that Mexicans are going to go into revolution, but in reality they were merely reminding the government that it's the citizen's choice who gets to be in power, no matter what any other organism says. The mid-term elections coming up this year will allow the political shift that will, hopefully, balance things enough again. Otherwise a more dramatic political shift will occur in 3 years during presidential elections. Right now there's a strong movement for smaller parties and independent candidates, if politicians care about their system they will cave to the people's desire to avoid such a system to appear.\n\nMexican democracy was built under extreme hardship, the kind the US has not lived. The IFE system was built to allow for full democracy in a system were the president had full control. Things like the Florida controversy in the Bush election do not fly in Mexico and people are more than wary about it: they are downright paranoid. Right two controversies exist:\n\n* You can still (illegally) buy the votes of people by hiding as swag, which is a big issue. Not much has been done over this because this is extremely hard to verify.\n* Locally the power of the IFE at state level varies and some states have been better at corrupting the local organization than others. They are creating a new national organism called the INE, it's controversial if this will be better or not, pros and cons.

This often requires key positions to be held by crew residing in a specific region, the script has to be set in a specific region, the characters are from a specific region, etc. This in no way requires that they are shown in a positive light.\n\n&gt; By the sound of it the article is just reporting what was found from leaked documents.\n\nThere's no mention of leaked documents in the article. \n\n&gt; In honesty, you seem to be getting pretty defensive about a relatively tame article.\n\nI'm not being defensive, I'm explaining how it works based on my first-hand experience. \n\n&gt; My guess is most movies they give $20 million to aren't showing Mexico in a bad light, whereas the Bond film was using it was a corrupt and dangerous backdrop -- it's not surprising they might change the conditions of their tax incentives if the movie itself departed from those they'd normally incentivize.\n\nYou acknowledge that you're guessing as to what could have spurred on any changes made to the script. You're not familiar with the requirements of Mexico's or any other tax incentive programs and you're refusing to hear the words of someone that works in that industry. \n\nIt appears as though this story may appeal to a bias you hold about gov't corruption and media influence. What you may not have considered is the fact that Bond was shooting in the UK and rewrote the script to take advantage of the new Mexican incentive. In effect, moving a large portion of the production from the UK to Mexico. In retaliation, the UK could have planted the article to apply pressure to the studio to keep the production in the UK and turn away from the Mexican incentive. \n\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 803, "question": "Id love to read the article but I don't think I can ever get through the ads (mobile)", "aSentId": 804, "answer": "Why aren't people taking about this more.

It's true that you have to compromise your principles sometimes to get into power, and a lot of guys in power have precious few principles or are unempathetic elitists, but that doesn't mean that you should give up on authority.

We are very selective when it comes to what pain we care about, and for some reason causing massive pain to male infants is not something we as a society care about. Go figure.

Circumcision-related mortality rates are not known with certainty; this study estimates the scale of this problem. This study finds that approximately 117 neonatal circumcision-related deaths (9.01/100,000) occur annually in the United States, about 1.3% of male neonatal deaths from all causes. Because infant circumcision is elective, all of these deaths are avoidable.

Once the Dagestani militias had pushed out the scum, Putin found himself surrounded by a cadre of rebels from the first war (including Kadyrov), who were more than happy to lead a pro-Russian autonomous republic.\n\nAfter the second wars end, Kadyrov and friends have done an excellent job running their autonomous state, and Chechens are some of Putin's strongest supporters. \n\nI have to reiterate this every time though. Nothing excuses what the Russian army did to Grozny. I do not support the liquidation of cities. \n\nI recommend you read up on the wars. They are very interesting, and a lot more complicated than \"evil Russian imperialists denying Chechen's freedom\". \n\nThe thing is, Chechens don't want it.

Low information voters would likely not consume nearly enough propaganda to overcome the sheer gravity exerted on political behavior by political identification. It is one of, if not the single strongest predictor public opinion research has of predicting voting behavior.\n\nAs for not a healthy basis, to an extent. Again, the idea in the research is that when low information voters have the choice between voting or not voting, voting and using low information cues is a better measure of their views than for them to not vote. So it would be a step in the right direction, healthier than what we have now, but certainly not as healthy as the origins of the United States when there was vast political efficacy and engagement on the part of the public in their government. That would be the best type of public for a healthy democracy...

When they had their revolution they didn't get the chance to piggy back on a wave of support because others had done it and succeeded.  They were the first to stand up and demand a change.  When that change wasn't what they wanted they stood up yet again and demanded change again.  \n\nIt's not going to be a simple solution and it's not going to come overnight but having lived here for a little bit (July 2014) I've gotten to know a lot of Tunisian people and they won't let their government sit by and let this go unanswered with some sort of action.\n\nMy wife is upset and is telling me that it's bad and believe me, it's bad.  It's bad because they killed tourists and this country thrives on tourists and the terrorists know if they can make this a scary place they can have a foot in the door to take it over.  The government will not just let that happen.\n\nWhen explaining my optimism to my wife I told her that maybe because I'm just desensitized to the whole situation.  Not that the events aren't horrific but I told her \"This is just a mall shooting where I come from.  This is just a theater shooting.  In the US we get this shit on the regular so maybe I just don't grasp how big of a deal it is\".  And maybe I still don't but I know that right now, the Tunisian people are gathering people in the center of the city to  protest/rally against terrorism just as they did in France.\n\nSo can I really say that with confidence after today's events? Yes and I am not just trying to dismiss it.  I am going to be living proof because as an expat living here with my wife, this will not change my day to day habits.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 5743, "question": "Ugh.

So Islam isn't bad because there are a couple good passages in it that no one follows? Not very convincing. Who are these majority muslims you are talking about, because they're sure as shit not in the middle east! Or Africa. The Quran also says they're not equal. Its full of contradictions. You should know that being a muslim. You too just pick and choose what little good is in there and discard the rest.

Indonesia. Turkey. America. There are 1.6 billion of us. If Islam is as evil as you say it is, then no one would be left alive. 1.6 billion is quite the army. The fact of the matter is that there are more 'good' Muslims than there are 'bad' ones; even if there was a majority of 'bad' Muslims, things would be a lot worse than the current state of affairs. You just don't hear about the good ones. The ones who volunteer, who give a percentage of their paycheck to charity, who give food to the homeless.\n\nHow do you know no one follows those passages? I follow them. My family follows them.  Many Muslims all over the world follow them. You don't know how I follow my religion, so, again, don't say if people are 'more Muslim' than I. Where does it say men and women are not equal? In Christianity (And I'm assuming Judaism, I don't know), the Bible says that Eve was born from Adam's rib. In Islam, man and woman were created at the same time, from whatever God made humans out of. Also, I talked about the rules for women because you were talking about Islam and women. So sorry for 'picking and choosing' relevant examples.\n\nThe Quran states \"Fight in the name of your religion with those who fight against you.\" Keep in mind, Islam was founded during a time where Muslims were actively at war and being killed for their beliefs. There are verses that are meant to be read as \"Sword Verses,\" i.e. War time verses, and \"Peace Verses.\" So context is very important in every single instance. People can interpret scripture differently, but the key term is \"Those who fight against you.\" One should only fight in self-defense. It promotes defense rather than offense. And that's a 'sword verse.' Even then, the person is only supposed to fight another soldier; he is forbidden from killing the soldier's wife, children, livestock, and farmland. \n\nIn a religion of 1.6 billion people, you're going to have shitty people. There are shitty people everywhere. I don't dispute this. There are non extremist Muslims who do bad things. It's called being *human.* \n\nYou're just sticking your fingers in your ears and going \"NAH NAH NAH I CAN'T HEAR YOU, I'M RIGHT YOU'RE WRONG.\" Nothing I say is going to change your mind, because you refuse to listen. So I hope you have a good night, and I wish peace be upon you. (Did you know that's what the greeting that Muslims give each other, 'As-salamu alaykum,' means?

In the 1990s, when the government of Georgia was comprised of corrupt politicians, thugs, nationalists and people of low qualifications, who produced a diplomatic failure and war. South Ossetia, just like Abkhazia, is too small to be able to be self-sufficient on its own - they simply do not possess the resources. Them breaking away would only result in them being failures economically and politically, which they have been for the past 20 years. Being part of Georgia gave them as much a chance to be better off as being \"aided by Russia\".\n\nAfter the war in 2008, during which Russia started occupying these territories on pretense of protection, which, honestly was justified by Georgian actions at the time, the population of these regions has been artificially altered - Russian citizens have been more and more prevalent, with ethnic Georgians and Ossetians and Abkhazians becoming a thing seen rarely. The bombing by Mikheil Saakashvili was not required, but very few things he did were. The ex-president is a madman who ate his own tie on national television and sanctioned torture in prisons in an attempt to \"better the population of the country\". What he did was not representative of what the general population wanted. \n\nRussia's actions on the other hand are further serving to destabilize the region, as the conflict between Russians and Georgians after the war have been high strung, with the Russian army being only 40 kilometers away from the capital of Georgia, Tbilisi. The border is being constantly moved by the Russian side in what would be considered a \"crawling annexation\" where very slowly the Russian army moves deeper into the country, taking over more Georgian soil. Russian \"aid\" being present in the Abkhazia and Ossetia regions only makes the aggression towards these regions stronger as Georgians cannot help but feel betrayed by what they once could have considered allies. Yes they were bombed, but in a similar fashion the US went through a Civil War, but the fact that the victors write history does not allow the south to be as sore about that conflict as you would expect them to be. Georgia has not been victorious in ages, so there is no surprise that justifying Russia and the separatists is this easy for this and their communities. This history is being written by Russia, and the truth about the ethnic and cultural background of the regions becomes fuzzy in the sweetened words and aid that Russia supplies.\n\nFact is, one cannot help but see why Georgia would be so desperate to keep these territories, but would fail to do so. A small country cannot afford to lose any more territory than it already has, and being ruled by an inept government guarantees that the means to attempt and restore the territories to the country will be undiplomatic and bloody. It is not the separatist's fault they wanted independence, but it is the fault of their stupidity that they were unable to foresee the pain and struggle they would go through on their own. Is it for their own good that Georgia wanted them to be part of it? Maybe not, but at least we were honest about it. We would be stronger together. It is better than Russia's benevolent hand, and its long term ethnic cleansing that shall only take away from the regions' cultures and leave the people of these rich regions extinct, with the new \"Abkhazians\" or \"Ossetiants\" of Russian descent being the only ones left, opening up a path that shall allow for the quick annexation of Georgia, where all of a sudden, Abkhazia and Ossetia become really friendly with Georgia, again. Historically the two territories have always been part of Georgia. Culturally this is obvious. Politically, especially when the regions are ruled by rich, corrupt politicians who are more interested in the money that Russia will supply to keep the region destabilized, it is obvious that it will be impossible for Georgia to ever win these territories, and their people, back. \n\nTL;DR Maybe you are right, but things are not as simple as they seem", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 8238, "question": "Sigh...

It works as an equalizer...the hard workers work hard, then the government comes in and taxes the fuck out of their income to redistribute to the lesser earners or non-earners. In turn, workers have no incentive to work hard because they can take the handouts and continue to live comfortably, Whether it is out of laziness, resentment, actual ineptitude, physical or mental disability, playing the system, etc...it doesn't matter. The even playing field has effectively removed the reward of hard work. Anybody who has taken a basic economics class can tell you that socialism is an optimistic yet unobtainable dream. I'm not arguing that it *wouldn't* be great if it could work...I'm arguing that it simply *can't* work. \n\nMy problem with it is that if some of the people figure that they don't need to work to get what they need, then the rest of the people realize they aren't going to get what they work for, nobody has any incentive to work hard at all. In order for socialism to work, you need cooperation from everyone within the society, and that's just something that will never happen. Have you ever had to work on a group project and you had a lazy slacker in your group that you and the other members had to pick up the slack for? YOU work extra hard and you all end up getting a good grade, but the lazy slacker received that same good grade and did not learn any sort of lesson. Next group he's in, since it worked out so well for him last time, he's going to pull the same shit. Now imagine trying to do that on a national level, but with a whole shitload of lazy slackers, and this group project never ends. There comes a point in time where the hard workers in the group decide that it's not fair that they work so hard and the slackers get the good grades, so they work a little less hard on the group project. When one person does this, the rest of the \"class\" can pick up the slack, but as more and more people feel as if they're the only ones working hard, they get discouraged, and they too begin to slack.

Customers in the city are typically less informed of how nature works.\n\nThe issues the supermarkets were having with less informed customers were that blemished food would be ignored by customers that would only pick the most visually appealing food because after all, all the produce was the same price. Without continual re-stocking over time this would create food sections that contained a higher percentage of \"blemished\" food than unblemished. This in turn would render a supermarkets fruit and vegetable section less appealing, running the risk of losing customers to competition. As a result supermarkets took a more pro-active appraoch to filtering food. If one supermarket does this and attracts more customers then all the local supermarkets follow suit. They make more money pre-emptively filtering blemished produce from reached the store than selling it and risking bothering uninformed customers.\n\nIn the US it's reached the point that large supermarket conglomerates have taken the strategies that worked elsewhere to their smaller market locations, but my experience in other places in Europe was the further you get from cities, the more informed the customers were about what produce was OK/not OK and the less likely that visually \"unappealing\" product would be filtered out.\n\nHowever that in turn creates a niche market for supermarkets that offer blemished products for a reduced price. One chain of supermarkets have started opening more locations near us and they advertise themselves as offering imperfect produce at a reduced price.\n\nDespite the above there's always the chance that a piece of truly rotten fruit sneaks through the cracks, and sometimes you'll pick up a piece of fruit only to see it's not only rotten but also a few of the ones underneath are too.

Several other countries have a nationalist party, and in the UK and France they've been gaining strength as well; if enough of them get elected they might turn over the whole apple-cart, at which point all \"right-thinking\" Europeans know it's just a matter of time until they start slaughtering people again.\n\nThe Euro is a separate issue and, naturally, much more driven by finances.

Right now they are a threat enough to justify defense spending, but safe enough to not really worry that things will get bad.\n\nIMO China is going to be dealing with large scale revolts by the male population very soon(5-10 years).  The government's family policies have created a crisis in the country because there just are not enough women. Literally millions of Chinese men have absolutely no hope of having a family; no hope of spreading their family to the next generation.  This is going to make it hard for a restrictive communist regime to hold it's power for much longer. \n\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 14120, "question": "You're saying it was Obama that alienated the Sunni population ,causing them to boycott the elections, which brought about a Shia dominated goverment back in 2005 and quickly collapsed into a brutal civil war in 2006? \n", "aSentId": 14121, "answer": "No not at all, especially since part of the terms of the US leaving Iraq was that the Sunni population was to be fairly represented in the government, and that the Shia dominated government would not start discriminating the Sunni people.

So \"officially\" our unemployment rate went from 20 something percent to about 5%. Which looks amazing, but its complete bullshit. \n\nJust like now the \"official\" exchange rate of Bolivares to USD is 6.30 Bs per $. What people dont know is that nobody gets access to that rate because you need permission from the government (which you wont get)  so almost everybody needs to buy foreign currency at the \"black market\" rate  whcih is currently 260 Bs per $  . That's 40 times more  than the \"official rate\" There was even a new system in place for regular people to officially buy/sell USD  at \"Free market price of 170\"  ir worked for about 15 minutes and now all operations are suspended until further notice. That little fuck up raised the dollar value here from 180  to 280 in less than a week. not it kind of stabilizied at 260. \n\nOur inflation rate was 68% last year.. and thats basically what the government is willing to admit. Most people see stuff that has doubled in price in less than a year.  It's just that our government says that some products are regulated like meat and they cost X ammount per Kg... problem is  you can't find ANY regulated meat without doing a 7 hour line at 4 am and hopefully get some. So people are forced to buy in places where they dont regulate prices so they can keep stock and stay open. So inflation is more likely above 100% per year. Meaning that all the money you made and saved last year is now worth half of what it did! Hooray!\n\nAnd then you see articles here about Venezuela and the armchair socialists come out the woodwork saying how amazing Venezuela is (even though they wouldn't live here) and how everything is so improved and better since chavez becuase this statistic  or this metric says so  which all come from?  The Venezuelan Government.\n\nIt's the same thing as you say, a shitshow on the inside that looks good on the outside. \n\nHopefully I can say the same thing as you in 10+ years about how it's so much better because right now it just gets worse and worse every year", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 14318, "question": "Are you seriously comparing IRAQI censored Internet to our \"censored\" internet?

You won't even give him hundreds of thousands? We can get into the millions if you want to count the Iraq and Kuwait Wars. Honestly dude. I haven't seen someone more sympathetic to Saddam by saying he killed THOUSANDS. The guy committed GENOCIDE. And you're saying he killed thousands. Give me a break.\n\nAnd yes, the U.S. supported Saddam. In fact, it was the CIA that brought him into power in the 1960s. It's that fact that puts the responsibility on the U.S. to get rid of him. It's the fact that the U.S. broke Iraq by putting a evil madmen in control of a country, that it's their responsibility to get rid of him. I don't argue against the atrocities the U.S. committed in the past, especially in the 60s-70s. They are very well known. \n\n&gt;I didn't mean to imply Iraq was some sort of earthly paradise without any sort of conflict, but the state was similar to, say, the Serbs and Croats in Yugoslavia prior to U.S. intervention. Iraq's ethnic populations intermingled, intermarried, and their lives/businesses were so intertwined, the idea of a Sunni-Shiite conflict on the scale we see today was nearly unthinkable.\n\nYet, you have no mention of the Kurds in your Sunni-Shiite conflict example. The Kurds literally went through genocide and had barely any human rights under Saddam's regime. A Sunni was much more vauable than a Kurd. Those ethnic issues are on a much higher scale than what we see today. Yes ethnic tensions are higher between Sunnis and Shiites, but that is an effect of war. Like I said before, the system needs more time before democracy can settle.\n\n &gt;The economy was fine under Saddam, it's only after 1990, when the U.S. imposed its sanctions (decried as \"genocidal\" by Denis Halliday of the UN -- and for good reason; the sanctions were responsible for hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths) that Iraq's economy began to decline. What's more, there's no evidence the sanctions were at all successful in persuading Saddam to change his brutal policies; rather, the sanctions only managed to strengthen Saddam's rule.\n\nYea, if you want to look at Iraq's economy as a whole it is 'fine'. The Iraqi economy under Saddam isn't as black and white as you portray it. Saddam used a good portion of government revenue on his family. As the poor died in ditches and drank sewer water, Saddam used gvt money to build new statues and palaces. As Saddam siphoned all the oil from Kurdistan's Kirkuk, the Kurds suffered in the desert with nothing to eat. That is NOT an economy. It is a corporation that operates under providing for the royal family.\n\nAlso it seems like you are anti- Iraq war, but you are also anti-economic sanctions. So while Saddam is committing genocide, aiding+housing terrorists, and invading and annexing parts of Kuwait's territory--what exactly is your plan of action of here?\n\n&gt;I could say this exact thing to you.\n\nExcept I'm not arguing that Iraq isn't terrible now. I know there's conflict as a direct result of the war. I'm arguing that it is better off than it was under Saddam.

You create room for other political structures to assume responsibility for what happens next, the more so the longer you're out. The nice thing about being an armchair general is you get to say things like he pulled out \"prematurely\". \n\nWhen you invade, you're responsible for most everything that happens until you leave, and for the potentially unenviable position of the people who have to decide when to leave; much of which is not immediately obvious.\n\nOur invasion of Iraq killed so many thousands of people, crushed an economy and infrastructure, and, no matter what you think of the regime at the time, directly contributed to the power vacuum and political discontent you see now. You want to assign blame, Bush is first, and in big, bold letters. \n\nSo maybe Obama's decision to leave early is partly responsible for the current mess. Maybe the US forces could have prevented IS's current aggression. But what about in 2 years? 5? 20? Or maybe the American public would not have supported a new ground engagement, and we had to pull out in further disgrace? Or maybe we pull out in 2020 and IS starts then. Is it president colbert's fault, in that case?\n\nAt least this way we can say, rightly- we bear some of the responsibility. But so do the political structures at the time. The Iraqi military's response has been a joke. Is that our fault? Not entirely. \n\nore importantly, to those saying the president should do more than point fingers- he makes a recommendation - he cautions the country against going in half cocked.

He started a war on false, or at least negligently ignorant premises. This war killed over half a million people, and destabilized the country and contributed to the further destabilization of the region. \n\nBut don't worry, I'm sure we're safer now from all them terrorists and totally completely real WMDs. It also cost as much money as it would have taken to pay for all of my generation's college educations *and* revamp most of the country's infrastructure. To pay for such, in his oh so glorious fiscal 'responsibility' he oversaw dramatic tax decreases while racking up those trillions in war expenses. It's not relevant, but those taxes are also staggeringly regressive, although passed at a time when wages had stagnated for around twenty years, meaning that he waged a senseless, unjustified war which he ensured would be paid for increasingly by Americans whose real incomes haven't seen growth in decades. \n\nBrilliant. As you can see, what we purchased with those funds was a functional, democratic country with an effective government that heals economic and social grievances by providing adequate services and opportunities, with a civic environment where historical ethnic tensions have a place to manifest in nonviolent elections and where the Army is a real asset of the state. /s \n\nI did not mention Syria or Libya because the comment I was responding to made a comment very obviously about US actions in Iraq. Other countries were outside the scope of a salient answer.\n\nBut since you bring it up.... \n\nThe Bush administration's continual reliance on isolating countries with whom it found dealings distasteful was certainly not helpful. Where might we now be if we had opened dialogue with Iran or Syria sooner? We'll never know, but that's eight years of potential diplomacy wasted. \n\nIf you want criticisms of Obama, fine. but Syria and Libya are not where you want to go with that. Look at Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Yemen; where the administration is continually breaking, bending, or rewriting international norms and US law so that we blow people up if we feel like it. Where we our constant, inhuman presence alienates and radicalizes the populace. If the administration's reluctance to fully enter another war is the result of lessons learned, it has yet even to consider how many more enemies we make when we bomb villages, homes, schools, and civilian roads, all the while categorizing civilians as combatants, in order to kill a handful of probable terrorists extrajudicially. It is quite directly as slap in the face to the system of governance and rule of law we claim to value. But I'm sure the lack of serious terrorist attacks is logically valid proof of such program's effectiveness.  \n\nIn syria, it's not clear what to do, at least to me. What would you have the US do? Give the rebels weapons? Which rebels, and what kind of weapons? Are you worried those groups will eventually turn against US interests, or worse, civilians, and necessitate yet another engagement in the country? Because you should be. Much more so, though, you should be worried about what happens if Assad's regime fails. As slimy as it is, it's one of the few things holding IS in check, and providing goods and services in the region. That government goes away, you're going to see a power vacuum significantly worse than what's happening in Iraq at the moment, only it'll be a free for all between various terrorist groups and IS to carve up land and civilian populations. So again, what would you do? I can't fault a president for being hesitant to make the mistake of his predecessors and run guns blazing into a conflict we know little about but which we will be assuming responsibility for. He earns some respect from me (or at least the administration does) for pushing the regime to restrict its use of chemical weapons. Did it save all the imperiled civilians? No. But it upholds a precious international norm I'd bet the bank will save lives in the future. \n\nAnd Libya... what to say? The government was slaughtering its own people. We declawed it, but again, are you so sure more fulling arming the rebels would have been a good idea? Are you so ready to commit our country to another war? Or is your criticism that we were involved at all, and should have stood idly by while a regime massacred its people and secured a mandate in blood? Again, I can't fault the president for a humanitarian impulse to intervene tempered by the painful lessons of the Bush wars. Could we have done much more? Sure. Should we have? Nobody has any bloody clue, but recent history should give you a healthy respect for a commander in chief cautious to ensnare the country in another war. \n\ntl;dr your comment seems to suggest everything I wrote was just a OBAMA GOOD, BUSH BAD.

However, that caused no problem at all for the United States or its citizens. Nor was he a problem for Christians living in Iraq.  Bush had him removed without any thought as to who or what would replace him, disbanded the Iraqi army, and implemented no coherent plan of occupation.  This unleashed a decade of sectarian violence, leading to thousands of American deaths and injuries, the squandering of $1 trillion of American taxpayer money, and the total collapse of Iraqi society. In other words, the invasion of Iraq turned Iraq into a failed state, allowing a splinter group from Al Qaeda (ISIS), along with remnants of the Iraqi army, to achieve their initial rapid success. This may be a preferable situation for the fellow posting from Iraq, but it is not for the United States or its citizens, nor for the Christians in Iraq. Same deal in Syria and Libya. Bush's invasion of Iraq caused all of it to happen. From a foreign policy standpoint, it is obviously easier to deal with brutal dictators than with three failed states. The invasion of Iraq has completely upended the Middle East, and will undoubtedly cause more American deaths, while continuing to drain our budget. I do agree that the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire was done in a haphazard fashion, but as we have seen, the people who inhabit these countries are unable to live together in peace without the heavy hand of a dictator.

As far as your belief that it wasn't our attempt to destabilize those countries you're wrong on principal. Any time there is a coup a nation by definition becomes destabilized. We just believed that when that it will eventually stabilize and when the dust settles what will be in place will be advantageous to our national interests. Not everyone shares American ideals and those that don't become really resentful when it's pushed on them. Forcing your way of life onto people will always leave a bad taste in your mouth. \n\nAs far as further military involvement in the area I'm not terribly sure the best course of actions. Things to consider: yes ISIS is killing people, but we need to let people fend for themselves sometimes. That sounds callous but we make that decision all the time. Book Harem is killing as many people in Africa as ISIS is in the middle east. People in North Korea gets killed by the government frequently as well as well as up 200,000 political prisoners in camps. Do we get involved everywhere there is injustice. Keep in mind that our fighting over there has eerily similar to the ussr's invasion of Afghanistan: A large over militarized military force going in and trying to fight guerilla warfare with tribes/militias/rebels with very loose central organization. Then once the USSR realized it couldn't win they transfered the fighting of the mujahideen to the Afghan armed forces while providing money, technical assistance, and air support. Sound familiar? That's exactly what we did in Afghanistan and Iraq now. The tactic we used to win the cold war against the USSR is the same tactic we're up against in these countries. We're also handling it the same way. So I think we need to just cut our losses and leave. Instead of spending the money to arm rebels and fight proxy wars again we need to find a new less subversive tactic in our middle east relations because we've been basically trying the same thing for 60 years now and it's only getting worse.

How long would we have to keep holding their hands?", "aSentId": 16508, "answer": "The problem wasn't holding their hands, or that their military is necessarily bad. The problem is that when the only jobs in the country are military, everyone joins the military. For a lot of them, their hearts aren't in it. They're not there because they *want* to fight. They're there for a check. When it comes time to actually fight, they disappear. \n\nThe only solution that really ever existed since the invasion was to babysit their country until their economy returned. Then the only people joining the military are the recruits that *want* to be there; that are actually *motivated to fight.*. We see this playing out with the Iraqi Special Forces units that are fighting daesh right now. They're actively fighting, and are motivated to remove daesh from their country. They are the soldiers that joined, then *volunteered* for additional military selection programs and additional training. They *want* to be there, and that makes all the difference in the world.\n\nAt this point a large portion of IA that remain are former Shi'ia extremists that al Maliki folded into the payroll, and that's going to be a big problem too. Daesh is Sunni, and once the Shi'ia IA starts pushing into Sunni Iraqi territory, currently held by daesh, they're going to hit a brick wall of resistance from daesh *and* Sunni civilians. \n\nThis whole thing is a huge fumble fuck. I'll be the first one to say \"we shouldn't have invaded\", but with that being the case, suddenly removing all the stability we achieved in the country was a disaster.

Do go on. ", "aSentId": 16542, "answer": "ok, I'm going to try to explain this.\n\nWhen tackling the gitmo closure you have two major problems to solve. The first one is what to do with the people you're going to release. A bunch of them have ended up in Uruguay because their countries of origin have refused to take them back, this problem has been mostly solved, but it took six years to find somewhere that would agree to take them, and it's still not completely settled.\n\nThe second much larger problem is what you're going to do with the people you're not releasing. Despite everything, there are a number of known terrorists at gitmo, none of the nations we could actually trust to hold these people are willing to, and in order to bring them into the states you'd need congress to approve a holding facility. \n\nThe whole reason the Bush administration started detaining suspected terrorists at gitmo in the first place was to avoid congressional involvement, but not because they feared congressional oversight, post 9/11 they could rely on national unity to get them what they wanted. No the reason that gitmo is the holding facility of choice is that it's one of the few places in the world where the president can simply order a prison to be built for the purpose of holding captured/suspected terrorists and no one can interfere. This was important at the time not for any really nefarious reason, but more to maintain political stability by not placing a giant terrorist holding facility in the US where people would have to deal with it. \n\nThis is where things get interesting.\n\nObama promised to close Gitmo if he was elected, as a political move this netted him a good gain among both his base and some of the more progressive libertarian movements. However it also handed the GoP a powerful tool to use against him when he became president, because he couldn't in good conscience close Gitmo without finding somewhere to hold the actual terrorists that were there. \n\nThe president lacks the power to establish such a holding facility in the states without congress, since the democrats never managed a supermajority in the house and senate during Obama's presidency he would need at least some republican support on this issue. Thus it could either be used as a bargaining chip for something they wanted, or simply held against him to force him into the position of reneging on his public promise. This is how politics really work at a high level, it's a game.\n\nIn the most basic terms of political gamesmanship, Obama would need at least some republican support in order to implement an effective closure of Gitmo, since without an act of congress he never had the power to make good on the promise in the first place. The republicans on the other hand have had more to gain by sitting on it since the longer the issue draws out the worse Obama looks and there's never been a political concession they wanted bad enough which Obama would be willing or could politically afford to give them to drop it.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 16544, "question": "He's not wrong.
