I dont think it's not really that much like K-means or GMMs, I just misunderstood it a bit before. It's more like some sort of local neighborhood classifier. \n\nI still have concern about the cases where you train n=1 for each class. How do you get the \"planet radii\" for those cases? With 1 value for each class you have nothing to indicate how big each class should be, so the planets should have the same radii and mass. You should get identically the same results as 1-nearest neighbor or k-means for those problems because your method would basically predict that a new value is the same class as whichever data point it is nearest to. The performance then really just depends on a lot of things like how well separated the classes are, whether each class has approximately the same number of samples or not, how well connected the true class boundaries are etc.  \n\nFor instance, if I gave you n=2 (x=1, theta=1) and (x=10,theta=2) I think your method would classify anything greater than 5.5 to class 2 and anything less than class 1. This method would be really bad if the true classes were {class 1: odd integers}, {class 2: even integers}. It would also be ok if the classes were {class 1: x&lt;2}, {class 2: x&gt;=2}, but not really great. It would also be bad if {class 1:generated by N(1,0.01)} and {class 2: generated by N(0,100)}.\n\nIn truth, no classification algorithm will do well with such little data, unless the groups are really easily separable, in which case many things will do pretty much equally well/badly. I think your method is really neat, but I think that using it's performance with 1 sample per class to argue for it is somewhat misguided. I think focusing on your other examples is better possibly adding a case with a simulated data example that is designed to show a case where other methods work badly and yours works well.\n\nAlso, changing topic and going back to something I mentioned before: I really recommend adding details on how you choose some of your parameters like the initial planet radii and such. If you want people to use the algorithm, you'll want to make it very clear how to implement it so that it's easy for them to do so.
