Yugioh is in no form simple, in fact its so complex that even some of the top tier judges get confused from time to time. \n\nTo start off with there is two regions, OCG and TCG, the TCG governs pretty much everywhere and OCG is mostly only Japan. OCG and TCG cards are to different things as defined by the rules, for example if I live in America (TCG zone) and have use an OCG card in any konami sanctioned/official match, doesn't matter what it is, hell it can be a 1 start common card, I am breaking the rules and lose the game (if its a match I lose the game and have to side deck the card out). \n\nNot only does OCG and TCG have different cards, they also have different rules. In the TCG the the battle phase is 7 steps, each with there own rulings. In the OCG there is an extra step. There are also differences in the end step. \n\nLasty card text is a mess, in the early cards translation was poor so you don't actually know when the cards effect is used, this can be critical because cretin cards can't be used in the battle phase, and its very key to know when you can/can't do something. Lastly priority is changed somewhat often, meaning you constantly need to get updated rule sets because konami just likes to change shit whenever they want for no real reason. \n\nI could go farther into it all, and even explain questions if people want.

All you can do to work that goal is decrease B.  You have a variety of ways to achieve that, and it is a relatively simple task.  All I can do to work towards that goal is increase A.  To do so, I can improve my deckbuilding skill, but at a certain point I'm going to have to increase X.

You can only use instant speed spells/abilities\n\n**Phase 2**: *Upkeep*, this is a phase where you have to pay for upkeep costs of your cards, or the effects of your cards for the most part will pop up here on your \"Permanent\"(cards that don't leave the field after you cast them) cards. Only cards you can cast are must be instant.\n\n**Phase 3**: *Draw*, Draw one card.\n\n**Phase 4**: *Main phase 1*, You may now play creature cards that are not at instant speed (aka instant/flash/abilities)\n\n**Phase 5**: *Combat phase*, You may now attack with creatures targeting the player you want to attack with any number of creatures. The creatures you attack with must tap (unless the card says otherwise) and can no longer use any abilities that use it to tap or defend until it untaps. After you declare attacks, the enemy can now choose it's creatures to block, he may put any number of creatures to block but each creature can only block one attacking creature. Once attackers and blockers are chosen there is a phase to assign damage, once damage is assigned this phase is over. Only creatures with flash and instant spells can be cast by players.\n\n**Phase 6**: *Main phase 2*, this is exactly similar to the main phase 1.\n\n**Phase 7**: *Discard phase*, this is the last phase if your hand has more then 7 cards discard any card in your hand till the number of cards in your hand equals to seven. You are now done your turn, it is the player in a clockwise order to play.\n\n***Basic Terminology***\n\n**Life**: This is your health, if this becomes 0 for any reason you are now out of the game. Everything on the field that you own now goes back into your deck.\n\n**Library**: If a card talks about your library is talking about your deck, if you have 0 cards in your deck and draw *OR* draw more cards then you have in your deck, you lose the game.\n\n**Graveyard**: this is a place where all cards go if they're destroyed.\n\n**Void zone**: this is the place if they are exiled, if a card targets the graveyard it cant touch this card.\n\n**Hand**: this is the cards you have in your hand, you start the game by drawing 7 cards into your hand, you may do a mulligan of your hand if you don't like the cards you have.\n\n**Mulligan**: There are several types of mulligans the most commonly practiced one is shuffling your hand into the deck and drawing one less card for each time you do this (you can do a friendly one free mulligan with no penalty but this is to stop your opponent to shuffle his hand to the perfect hand)\n\n**Mana**: is your resource and cost of cards, there are six resource types Mountain = Red / Island = Blue / Forest = Green / Swamp = Black / Plains = White, the sixth mana resource is called colourless it can be payed by any colour but can not pay for other colours (some lands produce colourless), you also might see a card that says produces is any mana, it does exactly that it can produce Red/Green/Blue/White/Black mana. At the top right corner of a card you will see a cost for a card. To play said card you have to have the required coloured mana and colourless plana to play it. Card with X in a grey circle means you may spend X amount of mana, and will effect the X part of said card. Mana goes back to 0 when you end a phase.\n\n***Cards***\n\n**1. Land cards**, land cards produce 1 mana based off their element if tapped for basic lands, non basic lands will give you a description of their effects.\n\n**2. Creature cards**, these are the soldiers of your deck and will have toughness and power. Power is how much damage they do, Toughness is how much damage they can take. Toughness is restored at the end of the players turn. When a creature is tapped it can not use it's tap effects or block. Creature cards when you first play them will have summoning sickness not allowing them to be tapped to attack or have an effect. A creatures power and toughness are shown on the bottom right corner like this *(Creature Power)* / *(Creature Toughness)*\n\n**3. Spell Cards**, there are two flavour of spell cards Instant and Sorcery. The only difference between these two cards is a sorcery can only be played during main phase 1 and 2. While an instant can be played at any time, and any players turn.\n\n4**.  Artifacts and Enchantments**, these cards will be cards that effect the field with effects that will stay on the battlefield/and or have multiple uses unless said otherwise. Artifacts can also be a prefix to a creature card making it have the effects of an artifact and a creature, and target cards that target either/or of these types.\n\n**5. Permanent cards**, Permanent cards are any cards that stay on the field this can be a creature/artifact/enchantment, when these die they go to the graveyard\n\n**6. Token/Counters**, These are cards that spawn through an effect for the most part these are creatures but they can possibly be enchantments, artifact or enhance a creature. When these die or go to your hand they simply vanish.\n\n**7. Planeswalker**, These are another type of permanent in the game  that generate loyalty counters and uses them for their effects. Like land they can only be used once a turn and only during your main phases. These cards can be only targeted if a card says target planeswalker or **PLAYER**.\n\n***Common Keywords you will see***\n\n**1. Flash**, this allows the card to be played at any phase at any time\n\n**2. Vigilance**, this allows a card to attack and not tap while doing so.\n\n**3. Flying**, this causes a card to only be blocked by other cards with flying and reach\n\n**4. Reach**, this causes a card to be able to block creatures with flying\n\n**5. Death touch**, if this where to do damage to a creature kill it.\n\n**6. Indestructible**, it cant destroyed through damage, it cant be destroyed.\n\n**7. Trample**, If a creatures power is greater then the blocking creatures toughness, your creatures power will spill over to the players life. Example a 3/1 trample is blocked by a 1/1 the creature takes 1 damage and the player takes 2, if he blocked with a 0/3 the player takes 0 damage.\n\n**8. Defender**, this creature can't attack\n\n**9. Haste**, this creature is not effected by summoning sickness\n\n**10. Lifelink**, this creature gives the player life based off how much damage it does\n\n**11. Protection**, this creature can not be targeted by whatever the creature is protected by (Protection from red, means it cant be targeted by red spells, cant be blocked by red creatures, and takes no damage while blocking red creatures, it cant take damage from red cards, HOWEVER it can still be effected by cards that target everything... so a white sorcery that says destroy all creatures and a creature with protection from white will still die.\n\n**12. Shroud**, this card can't be targeted by you or any other player... it can still be hit by spells that say all creatures\n\n**13. Hex-Proof**, this is exactly like shroud but only stops opponents from targeting it.\n\n**14. First strike**, this creature deals damage before any other creature when assigning combat damage (when you assign combat damage there is the first strike phase then default combat phase)\n\n**15. Double strike**, this creature attacks during the combat phase and the first strike phase, effectively making it hit twice.\n\n**16. Land Walk**, a creature can attack a player and may not be blocked if he has said land, if you have a mountain and a creature has mountain walk, this creature is unblockable\n\n**17. Intimidate**, a creature can attack a player and may not be blocked unless a creature shares it's colour is an artifact.\n\n**18. Unblockable**, a creature can attack a player and may not be blocked.\n\n**19. Legendary**, a creature with this on it, one may only exist on the field on either the enemy or players side. If two exist destroy them both.\n\n***UH OH, someone played a spell how do I react!***\n\nAlright someone played a spell... what can you do to react. Well it's pretty simple when a instant spell is played, other players can react to it in a clock wise manner Player A plays a spell, then Player B can do two things, let it resolve and Player A's action goes off, **OR** Player B can cast a instant/flash spell. If the latter is done now Player A has the same two options as player B. if there is multiple players go in a clockwise manner to see if a player resolves or reacts. It's that simple, when ever players plays a spell the player in a clockwise manner gets initiative and what ever (instant) card he plays has precedent over your first card!\n\nHere is what goes at instant speed, and these are the only cards you can use to react with. There is one effect you can not effect though through instant speed. If a card was tapped for mana you can not use instant speed spells to stop it, any gain of mana can not be reacted or responded too!\n\n**1. Instant Spells**\n\n**2. Tap Effects**\n\n**3. Cards with flash effects.**\n\n**4. Mana abilities.**\n\nAnd the last thing you need to know about reacting is. Just remember this with the stack ***LIFO***...

While an instant can be played at any time, and any players turn.\n\n4**.  Artifacts and Enchantments**, these cards will be cards that effect the field with effects that will stay on the battlefield/and or have multiple uses unless said otherwise. Artifacts can also be a prefix to a creature card making it have the effects of an artifact and a creature, and target cards that target either/or of these types.\n\n**5. Permanent cards**, Permanent cards are any cards that stay on the field this can be a creature/artifact/enchantment, when these die they go to the graveyard\n\n**6. Token/Counters**, These are cards that spawn through an effect for the most part these are creatures but they can possibly be enchantments, artifact or enhance a creature. When these die or go to your hand they simply vanish.\n\n**7. Planeswalker**, These are another type of permanent in the game  that generate loyalty counters and uses them for their effects. Like land they can only be used once a turn and only during your main phases. These cards can be only targeted if a card says target planeswalker or **PLAYER**.\n\n***Common Keywords you will see***\n\n**1. Flash**, this allows the card to be played at any phase at any time\n\n**2. Vigilance**, this allows a card to attack and not tap while doing so.\n\n**3. Flying**, this causes a card to only be blocked by other cards with flying and reach\n\n**4. Reach**, this causes a card to be able to block creatures with flying\n\n**5. Death touch**, if this where to do damage to a creature kill it.\n\n**6. Indestructible**, it cant destroyed through damage, it cant be destroyed.\n\n**7. Trample**, If a creatures power is greater then the blocking creatures toughness, your creatures power will spill over to the players life. Example a 3/1 trample is blocked by a 1/1 the creature takes 1 damage and the player takes 2, if he blocked with a 0/3 the player takes 0 damage.\n\n**8. Defender**, this creature can't attack\n\n**9. Haste**, this creature is not effected by summoning sickness\n\n**10. Lifelink**, this creature gives the player life based off how much damage it does\n\n**11. Protection**, this creature can not be targeted by whatever the creature is protected by (Protection from red, means it cant be targeted by red spells, cant be blocked by red creatures, and takes no damage while blocking red creatures, it cant take damage from red cards, HOWEVER it can still be effected by cards that target everything... so a white sorcery that says destroy all creatures and a creature with protection from white will still die.\n\n**12. Shroud**, this card can't be targeted by you or any other player... it can still be hit by spells that say all creatures\n\n**13. Hex-Proof**, this is exactly like shroud but only stops opponents from targeting it.\n\n**14. First strike**, this creature deals damage before any other creature when assigning combat damage (when you assign combat damage there is the first strike phase then default combat phase)\n\n**15. Double strike**, this creature attacks during the combat phase and the first strike phase, effectively making it hit twice.\n\n**16. Land Walk**, a creature can attack a player and may not be blocked if he has said land, if you have a mountain and a creature has mountain walk, this creature is unblockable\n\n**17. Intimidate**, a creature can attack a player and may not be blocked unless a creature shares it's colour is an artifact.\n\n**18. Unblockable**, a creature can attack a player and may not be blocked.\n\n**19. Legendary**, a creature with this on it, one may only exist on the field on either the enemy or players side. If two exist destroy them both.\n\n***UH OH, someone played a spell how do I react!***\n\nAlright someone played a spell... what can you do to react. Well it's pretty simple when a instant spell is played, other players can react to it in a clock wise manner Player A plays a spell, then Player B can do two things, let it resolve and Player A's action goes off, **OR** Player B can cast a instant/flash spell. If the latter is done now Player A has the same two options as player B. if there is multiple players go in a clockwise manner to see if a player resolves or reacts. It's that simple, when ever players plays a spell the player in a clockwise manner gets initiative and what ever (instant) card he plays has precedent over your first card!\n\nHere is what goes at instant speed, and these are the only cards you can use to react with. There is one effect you can not effect though through instant speed. If a card was tapped for mana you can not use instant speed spells to stop it, any gain of mana can not be reacted or responded too!\n\n**1. Instant Spells**\n\n**2. Tap Effects**\n\n**3. Cards with flash effects.**\n\n**4. Mana abilities.**\n\nAnd the last thing you need to know about reacting is. Just remember this with the stack ***LIFO***... Last in First out.\n\nThis might seem like a lot to get into but, Magic teaches through repetition and basic ideas. Duh my guy on the ground cant hit the bird because it will fly right over him, or Duh my creature isn't tired when he attacks because he is Vigilant to do his job!\n\nA deck must consist of 60 cards minimum (aim for 60 cards), you may only have 4 of a card with the same name, BASIC lands have no limit. 1/3 of your deck should be lands (20 lands), (20-30 Creatures) and (10-20) spells is a sweet spot for beginners.\n\nThere is other keywords on cards, but these come from older cards and I have a doubt you will see Poison/Horsemanship, but you might have to research some more recent ones. Also if your kid uses a card and it says **Banding** you can ***legally*** disown him.", "aSentId": 24063, "answer": "So, it's like playing WAR but with wizards.

But more wrong.\n\nNo one receives priority during the Untap step. Upkeep is the first chance for either player to do anything. The rest is written kind of colloquially, but serviceable.\n\nEnd Phase (not Discard) has two steps: End Step and Cleanup. The End Step is the last chance for either player to do anything before the turn flips over. Cleanup is where \"until end of turn\" effects wear off and you must discard down to hand size. No one receives priority during the Cleanup step.\n\nThe actual rule for \"decking\" is \"if you are required to draw more cards than are left in your library\". It covers all cases.\n\nThey changed the Legend rule and Planeswalker uniqueness rule. Now, it only checks your side of the battlefield. And the Legend rule checks to see if two Legendary permanents have the same name. If they do, you choose one and put the other in the graveyard. The Planeswalker uniqueness rule checks the types of your Planeswalkers and if two share a type, one is put in the graveyard.\n\nAdditional:\n\nThe two biggest things to grasp playing Magic are __priority__ and __the stack__.\n\nYou can only do things when you have _priority_. It's essentially a fancy way of saying who can do something.\n\nWith few exceptions, the player whose turn it is (known as the Active Player) gets priority first.\n\nThe stack is where spells and abilities go before they resolve, or take effect.\n\nNormally, you can only cast spells or activate Planeswalker Loyalty abilities when you have priority and the stack is empty. The exceptions are Instants and cards with the Flash ability. Unless otherwise specified by the card, you may activate any other ability anytime you have priority and can pay the costs.\n\nI wouldn't worry too much about mana abilities just yet.

The game is all about priority and who has it. Active player has priority when the stack is empty. Then they use that to start casting something.\n\nAlso, after casting a spell, the first player to receive priority is actually the player who cast the spell. It's just implied that the caster is passing priority to give the opponent a chance to respond.\n\nEven in your scenario, a player can't \"drop 500 cards down at the same time\" because they can only cast most permanents when they have priority and the stack is empty.\n\nThe stack and priority is not really that hard to understand. It's much better than the old LIFO/FIFO batch system that existed prior to 6th Edition.\n\nAnd you explained end step incorrectly and not at all the same. There is a clearly defined end step _before_ you discard down to hand size. That is actually the last chance for either player to do something before the turn flips. So if you have over 7 cards in hand, you have to notify your opponent before you discard that your turn is ending.

It's great that biking helped you build character but magic can build character just as well if not better than biking as a hobby (depending on what you decide to take from it).  Our society is determined to drill into the minds of our youth that if you're not an active all-star you're going to be a failure in life.  The video games, and card games, and board games you play provide you nothing in life.  This is what society still tells us.  Who I am now is a large result of what I did in my youth which was mainly play games.  I feel I can react to situations much faster than my peers and can often think logically through a situation without letting too much emotion come into play.  I feel this is a result of video games building my character up.  \n\nAlso MTG is as expensive as you're willing to make it.  A bike is going to be thousands of dollars.  No ifs, ands, or buts.  You're gonna spend thousands of dollars on a good bike and thousands of dollars on repairs/modifications.  MTG can be a thousand dollar+ hobby but it doesn't *have* to be.  Biking *is* a thousand dollar+ hobby.  \n\nYou can make anything a learning opportunity to build character.  It's up to you whether or not you decide the thousands of hours spent in WoW helped you as a person or whether you feel it's a waste of time.  I would say a majority of our society would say it would be a waste of time which reflects poorly on our society in its current state in my opinion.  Just because one person failed to learn anything from their time invested does not mean everyone failed to learn anything from their time invested.\n\nIn the end a dirt bike would be a lot of fun for a kid and if the dad thinks it'd be a better bonding experience by all means give him a dirt bike!

Thus if you want to play trumpet alongside a song in the key of C you have to play the song in the key of D (from the perspective of the trumpet player). This puts songs originally in B into the key of C# where the major scale is \"C#-D# - E# (f) - F# - G# - A# - B# (C) - C#\". Now \"B\" is not a very friendly key to begin with (5 sharps) but it's not like unheard of.

The companies with all the buying power have taken to releasing the same crap every year, year after year. And the mindless masses eat it up. Every title becoming more and more filled with \"in game purchases\" titles which are released without even having been properly tested because they're afraid that it would delay their launches and cost them money. Embargo's preventing proper reviews because the developers know the game is already broken. Titles which are hyped so heavily that they even tell the public that a game cost X to develop and then include the marketing costs in order to develop even more hype (like destiny) while at the same time a small games developer like \"squad\" or \"505\" or \"Mojang\" will come along and make something innovative enjoyable, and interesting something which makes people sit up and take note.  \n\nI never said there are \"absolutely no good/innovative games\" that's what you said. I just implied that when games like pitfall where released, developers actually wanted to make good games, sure they would compete against each other for their space under the family TV, but they wouldn't try to directly sell products to people while they played. They didn't want to just pack everything with in-game shops and DLC selling people half a game. Its just lazy. In the old days a full game might cost \u00a340, these days a full game, including the DLC might cost upwards of \u00a3150 and they would sell people a game which is hardly any different from the year before.

I respect the sight from valve to have your games on drm and they provide enough features to give good incentive to go along with it. however as for having DRM free systems i can see yet other benefits for example an indie developer myself can use DRM free systems to get my game out to more players, and if the game is good (which i intend it to be) having a tournament hosted by other individuals puts more publicity towards my game, pirated, or not. and now making a tournament for a game house is much much easier and therefore can have incentive to do it since now it is so cheap to bring to fruition. even if you put it on GOG.com if your scared of them pirating it then simply put a donation thing on the game, if they indeed pirated it then if they enjoyed the game now they can simply donate some money to your studio. \n\nanother thing which bugs me is how focused devs are on money.. why? if your game is good and you put the effort to get it out there then people will play it, and sometimes if you let them will buy it twice over! i know i did that for \"garry's mod\" when i lost my first steam account. that game was too good not to have in my library. pirating is something that WILL happen wether you have drm or not. it's a case of if you ignore them or allow a ways for them to support your game even if they pirated it. even if they decide not to pay they still enjoyed your game and will likely talk about it with others, and if they are the type to simply pirate and forget.. well the only real thing you can do is ignore that guy and move on to make another game or make the game you have made better through feedback from the communitty.\n\nEdit: spacing and grammar", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh03", "qSentId": 27567, "question": "technically it is purchased.. just enjoy it best you can and don't go handing it off to others, the game is stupid cheap right now and they shouldn't need to pirate it.", "aSentId": 27576, "answer": "I know, i could buy it if I wanted to, but I do not have the bandwidth to download it atm", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh03", "qSentId": 27577, "question": "I know, i could buy it if I wanted to, but I do not have the bandwidth to download it atm", "aSentId": 27578, "answer": "You don't have the bandwidth at the moment?
