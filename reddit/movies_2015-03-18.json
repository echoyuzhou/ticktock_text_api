While it has a lot going for it the film has several major stumbling points for me. Destroyah and Godzilla's presence opposite each other is completely divorced until the latter portion of the film, and the human story is basically just pointless padding that goes nowhere. Destroyah himself also isn't much of a kaiju. Yes he's big, evil looking and powerful, but that's all he is. Kaiju are at their best when even as bestial creatures they're somewhat relatable. This is why the Mutos in the new film were such great kaiju, because not only where they monstrous and powerful but we could sympathize with them and understand them on a deeper level.\n\nDestroyah is like the Godzilla equivalent of a Marvel movie villain at their worst. He puts on a mean display but there's basically nothing to him. He's more like a prop than a character. As he was the final adversary of the Heisei era it's a major letdown.

It's only remembered for being good because they handle the 'death' of Godzilla so well, but the rest of the film is a huge mess. That being said, killing off popular pop-characters wasn't even that inventive since the Death of Superman made that story popular in the early-mid 1990s.\n\nI see it as a film that capped a series so starved for ideas and tickets sales that they basically took the last nuclear option (pun intended) to make an impact on box office returns. Plus it was a set up to clear the theaters so that Sony would take on the banner of producing new Godzilla films in America.\n\nIf you want to watch actual good Kaiju films from the mid 1990s, check out the Heisei Gamera trilogy. They were able to make films that were considerably higher in quality and entertainment factor for around half the budget of the 90s Godzilla films.

Fleming never liked Connery to begin with and preferred that David Niven would have played the spy.\n\nQ and M are codenames with a bit of history.  Q is short for Quartermaster.  The head of SIS Quartermaster Branch in the novels is Major Geoffrey Boothroyd.  This is one character in the government role of Q.  There is no other Q in the novels.  Also, this is the name of a British firearms expert who was an avid fan of Fleming.  It was the real Geoffrey Boothroyd who wrote Fleming and convinced him that Bond should trade his Beretta for a Walther PPK.\n\nM is the codename for the SIS Foreign Section Chief.  Aside from Sir Frederick Gray, the Minister of Defence, M's nickname comes from a real historical fact:\n\nSir Mansfield Cumming founded the Secret Intelligence Service, and would sign classified documents with the initial C.  Since then, all Foreign Section Chiefs have used the initial \"C\" to sign/authorize classified documents.\n\nFleming himself was an operative in British Naval Intelligence during World War II under Rear Adm. John Godfrey.   It was commonplace then for British intelligence to recruit writers/journalists for their ability to socially engineer their way into certain social circles and locales that were off limits to most of the public.  Naval Intelligence had also recruited W. Somerset Maugham around that same time.

Not as modern, without XD or IMAX or other large-format theaters? These premium theaters are a goldmine. Lots of people come to the theater not even realizing that the showtime they arrived for was the large format (and astronomically more expensive) theater. Admittedly a short-sighted mistake on their part in this case, but it happens way more often than you'd think.\n\nNot to mention that theater chains are increasing their prices more every year, and in a steady upwards pattern - where last year some theaters bumped up prices a collective $0.50 last year, they're increasing it $0.60 collectively this year, and so on. May not seem huge but it certainly adds up, and it certainly shows the theaters having to compensate for decreased attendance. This means as less people go to the theater (for perfectly understandable reasons), the people who *do* attend regularly will have to pay more and more.

So young adults will see more bang for their buck by foregoing movie theaters and just getting Netflix. But if young adults are anything like I was when I was their age, they have the option to pirate films and pirating movies today is way easier then it was back in 2000 and the quality of the pirated material is way better. So now not only do young adults have less disposable income they have alternative methods of obtaining what they want.

I'm going to get into spoiler territory here, so read on at your own discretion.\n\nI think the film is very aware of what it is depicting with the scenes of him as a child at the dinner table and his father talks to him about the three types of people.  When we see him beating up the bully it could have been played as a heroic moment, but it's not.  Instead what we get is rather brutal violence.  We're witnessing the birth of American aggression.\n\nI think they give us the scene of him finding his ex cheating on him for this very same reason.  The only way he knows how to resolve this situation, and any situation we have seen is through violence.  He's someone who has been raised to believe that this is how men behave and take care of business.\n\nI thought the movie very clearly and compellingly showed a man who slowly becomes a shell of himself after going to war (a war that is questioned by multiple characters in the movie).  A system that took full advantage of this aggressive mindset, used him and then spit him back out.\n\nAs far as \"every Iraqi\" being shown as a terrorist.  I disagree.  I think many are, and part of that is just based on the scenarios that the film is depicting.  But even still the movie very consciously I think puts parts in to make you question this.  Remember what happens to the one Iraqi we see who truly tries to help him.  He is brutally murdered (along with his child) by the Butcher, who then shouts to those left in the village that this is what happens if you help the Americans.\n\nThis is immediately before we get the scene with them being served dinner in the house by the seemingly kind Iraqi family, and I don't think it's by accident that this scene comes next.  They find a cache of weapons being hidden in their home, but implying that this is an example of them being evil terrorists I think is simplifying it.  We've seen now first-hand what happens to those citizen caught in the middle of this war who help the Americans.  To me it's kind of analogous to the intense scene in the film \"Platoon\" where they visit the village holding a stockpile of weapons. \n\nIn another scene, and I admit it's kind of blink or you'll miss it, there is even a higher up that brings into question whether or not someone Kyle shot was even armed.  His response is typical - something like \"I don't know what a Quran looks like, but the man had a gun.\"  It may seem like a throwaway moment, but I don't think they threw it in there for no reason.\n\nI also think the enemy sniper is meant in a way to be a mirror to the Kyle character.  I'm thinking of one specific moment where I believe we cut from a scene of Kyle with his family to Mustafa who's sitting down in a room with a woman and child, who I assumed was his family.\n\nAnyway, it's fair to argue whether or not you think any of these points are *effective* but I think people are simplifying this film to a rather absurd degree.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 6111, "question": "As a brit watching it, it seemed very 'America Fuck Yeah!'

It isn't like what we see in movies and there's nothing glorious about it.  Next we see that it is unfair.  People get left behind in the war zone and risk their families, a man's son gets killed because he couldn't get out.  Finally it shows the effects all of it has on Chris.  When a kid picks up a rocket launcher he almost goes into a panic attack because he knows he will have to kill the kid before he fires.
