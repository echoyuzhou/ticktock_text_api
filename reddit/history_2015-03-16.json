You just go back to the beginning of the standardization of the Julian calendar in AD 8, and then apply the Gregorian method for any leap years (so Julian and Gregorian are EXACTLY the same until the year 100).\n\nIf you look at my first post, I say that \"if you were to use a proleptic Gregorian calendar\"; a proleptic calendar here just means that it's basically anachronistic and that one is trying to apply it to a period when it wasn't in use (i.e. using the Gregorian calendar before 1582).\n\nSo in 1582, there was a 10-day difference between the Julian and Gregorian calendars, because that was how much a gap had arisen between the two methods. However, not every society switched over to Gregorian at the same time. For example, the British (and thus the Americans) didn't switch over until the 1700s, so the difference between the two calendars was 11 days. When the Russians finally switched over to Gregorian in 1918, the difference was 13 days.\n\nThe main reason I suggested that 13 March might be the probable date is that between 44 BC and AD 8, they often did a leap year every 3 years, so you sort of have to adjust the difference by around -2, hence 13 March.\n\n(15 March, 44 BC is in the Julian calendar, by the way; you usually use the Julian Calendar for historical dates from 46 BC to 1582).\n\nEDIT: I'm not going to touch the commentary on the vernal equinox, because I'm working off the actual calendar system, not astronomy. Our annual calendar doesn't readjust based on the astronomy, so I'm not taking it into account (liturgical calendars have their own reasonings that I'm not going to touch).", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh53", "qSentId": 1025, "question": "The math is making my head hurt a little, but I think the date difference does matter in some way.

I may run out of steam:\n\nIn 1960, Lincoln is elected and most of the Southern States elect to secede, believing that his reign would lead to the end of slavery, although he himself never claimed that he would abolish the \u201cpeculiar institution.\u201d Lincoln refuses to give up military installations in the South. The Army of Virginia begins to form after a Southern battery fires on Ft. Sumter in Charleston Harbor to evict the Union troops there in April 1861. These were the first shots of the Civil War. Lincoln orders a blockade of all Southern ports, preventing cotton from getting to Britain, which relied heavily on the resource for its textiles.\n\nThe buildup of troops in Maryland elicits a similar buildup in Virginia, and as the Union attempts to move into Virginia to protect Union assets, the two armies meet at the First Battle of Bull Run/Manassas. The South wins handily under the command of Joseph Johnston and Thomas Jackson. In the meantime, Grant begins a campaign in Tennessee and does very well, and will be largely successful throughout the war in the west.\n\nIn April 1862, Grant barely holds out against a Confederate surprise attack at the Battle of Shiloh in Tennessee. In Virginia in June, McClelland is embarrassed by Lee at the Seven Day's Battle, in which Lee reverses attempts by McClelland to push toward Richmond, the Confederate capitol. The victory gives Lee the confidence to order an invasion of the North, believing that attacking Washington will force the North to accept the secession.\n\nIn September, Lee invades Maryland. In one of the biggest mistakes and dumbest blunders in military discipline in history, a Southern general leaves behind the battle orders of Lee wrapped around some cigars that are found by a Union soldier. As a result, McClelland is able to counter the invasion, barely, at Antietam, despite heavy losses on both sides. Lee is forced to withdraw, but the Army of Northern Virginia rallies around Lee, their morale intact. \n\nThis pseudo-victory gives Lincoln the mandate to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, which he issues in January 1863, freeing all the Confederate slaves, while maintaining slavery in the Union-controlled border states. Weird, but effective, as it creates a political problem for the British, who felt uncomfortable supporting the slave-holding South, and will end up not actively supporting the South as a result.\n\nBurnside, McClelland's replacement, moves south into Virginia in December 1862 and attacks Lee at entrenched, raised positions at Fredricksburg, and the Union army is slaughtered and retreats. Grant, meanwhile, begins his campaign to take Vicksburg, Mississippi in order to control that vital river and split the South. It will turn into a long siege.\n\nHooker, the new Union general, is surprised at the battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, being brilliantly flanked by Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson, and the Union is routed back into their own territory. It is Lee's greatest tactical victory. Jackson is accidentally shot by his own patrols and dies, but Lee has the momentum and invades again, this time into Pennsylvania. George Meade replaces Hooker, as Lincoln continues to look for a general that will actually fight intelligently.\n\nIn July 1863, Lee makes a strategic error and matches up against a now prepared Northern army at Gettysburg, PA. This time the Union has the high ground and Lee feels compelled to attack, despite the odds. Over three days, the two armies clash and on the third day, July 4th no less, Lee\u2019s army is defeated and forced to retreat back into Virginia. It is the first true victory by the Union. Meade fails to pursue immediately, and single-handedly ensures the war will go on for two more years. In the west, on the same day, Vicksburg falls to Grant after a grueling siege. It is a great day for the Union.\n\nThe Fall of 1863 sees the Union lose badly to Braxton Bragg in Tennessee at Chickamauga, then win under Grant two months later at Chattanooga. It should be noted at this point that numbers of casualties in all of these battles number in the tens of thousands, as old tactics fail to match the new technology of rifled guns and advanced artillery methods.\n\nAfter the winter, Lincoln puts Grant in charge of the Army of the Potomac, while William T. Sherman replaces Grant in the west. The two will manage a coordinated effort to pinch the South from two sides. Grant begins a campaign to again march to Richmond, while Sherman marches his 100,000 men in the west toward Atlanta. Grant wins several battles but loses badly at Cold Harbor, and makes another mistake failing to make an easy capture of Petersburg, south of Richmond. It is now a war of attrition, with Grant besieging Lee at Petersburg, VA hoping to cut off rail lines to Richmond and choke the capitol. During the nine-month siege, the Union attempts to tunnel under the Confederate lines and detonate tons of TNT in hopes of blowing a hole in the lines, They only manage to create a crater into which they get trapped. It\u2019s a turkey shoot dubbed the \u201cBattle of the Crater.\u201d\n\nFrom May to September 1864, Sherman wrecks the Southern infrastructure on his way to Atlanta, making total war on the South. He captures Atlanta and keeps going, making his \u201cMarch to the Sea,\u201d reaching Savannah just in time for Christmas, and leaving a destroyed Georgia in his wake. In the same month, Union General Thomas defeats Hood\u2019s army in Tennessee, ending the South\u2019s ability to fight in the west.\n\nJanuary 31, 1865, the 13th amendment to the Constitution is passed, abolishing slavery officially throughout the whole United States. Slaves in the south have no idea yet, but they will.\n\nLincoln is reelected in March, as Sherman moves north through South and North Carolina, destroying everything and having a good ol\u2019 time. In April 1865, Lee attempts another miracle and attacks Grant\u2019s lines, hoping to break out and coordinate elsewhere. He fails, and his army retreats out of Petersburg heading back toward Richmond. Richmond is essentially shelled into the stone age and Lee retreats.\n\nGrant\u2019s 120,000 troops chase Lee\u2019s 25,000 troops, until Lee humbly surrenders on April 9th, 1865 at Appomattox Court House in the parlor room of the man who had owned the land on which the First Battle of Bull Run had been fought. It\u2019s a weird little coincidence. \n\nLincoln was at the height of his power and popularity when he is assassinated by John Wilkes Booth at Ford\u2019s Theater on April 14th, 1865. His Vice-President, Andrew Johnson, would assume the responsibility of bringing the South back into the United States.\n\nThe Southern army is allowed to return to their homes, albeit without their weapons. Lee is briefly detained before being released, and is largely respected by both Grant and his army. Jefferson Davis, the Confederate president, is placed under arrest and imprisoned for two years until eventually being released and ultimately pardoned. He was never quite contrite, but outlived most of the other players of the war. Individual fighters were never tried for treason. However, the entire south was punished through several stages of reconstruction, the worst period being the era following Johnson\u2019s attempt, known as the Congressional period, or Radical Reconstruction, when the toughest measures against the Southern states were implemented.  Though too extensive to explain here, the Southern states were required to demonstrate implementation of various policies designed to ensure loyalty, protect the rights of newly freed southern blacks, and pay for the war. In addition, Radical Reconstructionists in Congress supported various types of advantage seekers hoping to make a profit off the Southern crisis. This led to intense resentment that literally still exists today, passed down by die-hard Southern families to their children. \n\nPresident Hayes would call an \u201cofficial\u201d end to Reconstruction in 1877 by removing all military presence of an authoritative nature from the Southern states. Black men would see a period of enfranchisement, including inclusion of the 14th and 15th amendments, which were a direct response to the need to protect black voting and prevent discrimination. However, the rise of white supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan, often led by former Confederate leaders, would initiate a long period of terror, murder, and de facto slavery in the form of \u201cJim Crow\u201d laws and bitter treatment, vying for the day that the South would \u201crise again.\u201d\n\nEDIT: A modifier.\nEDIT: A clarifier.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh53", "qSentId": 1561, "question": "1992 Presidential Debate", "aSentId": 1562, "answer": "What differences do you notice between the party factions in 1992 compared with today?\n\nHow would historical events have played out if Perot or Bush had become President in 1992?\n\nWas George Bush wearing a rubberized suit with battery powered lightning superpowers that could shoot out electricity like Emperor Palpatine?\n\nWhere is the Third Party movement today?", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh53", "qSentId": 1564, "question": "So what is /r/history's take on John Mosier's books?", "aSentId": 1565, "answer": "I was okay with the \"Myth of Blitzkrieg\", he makes some fairly decent points about the difficulties of tank warfare, the dangers of putting too much faith in an armoured breakthrough, and also in challenging the idea that \"the Germans worked on tanks, while everyone built fortifications\" in the 30's.

The trouble is getting there. \n\n- You won't get rich. Compared to what other highly qualified people make, it's obscenely little. The Scrubs that are freshly out of med-school and work the night-shift in the hospital make twice as much as me. \n\n- All the jobs are temporary. Most jobs in the academic field these days have a pretty strict clock on them. You get them for two years if you are lucky, one year is possible but you might also just get them for the duration of a semester. \n\n- You will be expected to move. A lot. As part of an academic career it is expected of you these days to move around in the world a lot. This comes especially true in the post-doc-time. Are you prepared to uproot yourself to spend two years in indonesia or somewhere else? Are you planning on having a family and settling down? Moving around can also be made neccesary by the time-limited nature of most academic jobs. \n\n- There are (almost) no more mid-level positions in teaching. The kind if job you are describing 'I want to teach at college level' is becoming some sort of unicorn. Universities simply no longer want to or have to means to employ highly qualified people in lasting teaching positons. The future looks like this: You have the top level with the profs. They have permanent positons. And you have the lower level, which are the people with fresh masters or fresh post-doc people. The lower level gets exchanged every few months or so, due to the time limit on their jobs. \n\nSo in summary I would give to pieces of advice: \nFirst, don't listen to the bullshit. People are always going on about how a job in the humanities is not possible, low paid etc. That's just nonsense. It is possible, but you got to face the realities of the situation. Those are that your jobs will involve a lot of moving, switching places, require you to be highly skilled and will pay you not even quarter as much as some frat-boy with a medical degree gets. \n\nSecond, know what you are getting into. As I said, a career in the academic field has some severe limitations and downsides, particularly on how able you are to settle down and start a family with financial security. You don't have these sorts of problems if you opt to be a High School Teacher.

I think it is really important to differentiate and to look into the individual history of every person to get the right picture of what kind of person he was in the context of his time. just like you i'm trying to find out more about my ancestors and thereby about myself. therefore i wish you the best of luck in your research.  \n\nI guess for me this is my heritage, burden and responsibility as a german to make sure something like this will never happen again.
