It's a shallow caricature of a character (yes, it's lazy writing) but you can't say he doesn't do it to a T. He can't do much else, but hey, he doesn't really need to in the context of the show. And the masses just eat it up.\n\nThe money just goes towards popularity. For example, Always Sunny is LITERALLY my favorite show; I think I've watched it through 5 times now... but it's not super accessible. It takes a little time to warm up to the fact that the gang are all incredibly shitty people (which is a big reason they're so incredibly funny), and honestly it turned me off to it the first time I watched it. But never seen an episode of BBT? You can get each character, you get the jokes, you can see the humor. It's all very... \"pleasant\".

In other traditional sitcoms the main characters are usually *as worst* indifferent or dull, while wacky/humorous situations happen to them, driving the comedy. With both Seinfeld and Community, though, quite often the comedy comes from the characters themselves being neurotic or just plain evil (not EEEEVILL like the froo-eets of the Dev-eel, mind you, just decidedly not good).\n\nI know they're not perfect parallels, but I see a lot more similarities between Seinfeld and Community than I do, structure-wise, between Seinfeld and Frasier.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh6e", "qSentId": 21686, "question": "How does it compare to Seinfeld?

Thats why so many shows involve cops, doctors or lawyers. Every week a new case arrives.\n\nHorror stories are difficult to have a story engine for. If the threat doesn't get you episode after episode then it's no longer scary. There are a couple of ways around that.\n\nYou can restart your story every episode or series using the anthology style like Black Mirror or American Horror Story. This is also why movies work so well with horror compared to Tv because they are naturally standalone pieces\n\nYou can have your characters actively seek out supernatural like Buffy or Supernatural. This mostly removes the horror though and it becomes an adventure show with horror elements.\n\n\n\nYou can have a serialised horror threat like Sleepy Hollow or the Walking Dead. This is the most true as a horror show but the threat is difficult to maintain and it's extremely easy to swerve into soap opera and lose the horror elements.\n\nPsychological horror like Bates Motel or Hannibal is probably the best format for TV horror. These shows aim for menace and creepiness rather than actual fear so they can be sustained for longer.

She had no loyalty; you may call that a tough as nails approach to a cutthroat business, but she was not a nice person by any stretch of the imagination. We're told that she said outrageous things, attacked everyone, but it was all in good fun, she didn't really mean any of it. Bullshit. Don Rickles doesn't really mean any of it - you see him going after someone and then in an instant reminding them, \"Hey, I'm just kidding\" and you can tell there's this underlying sweetness to him. Joan Rivers didn't have that - it was all mean, it didn't matter who she crapped on to get ahead, she would crap away. \n\nI'm sorry, I am judging once again but that is a part of life - we make judgments about people all the time and this is my opinion of her.

There was even a short teaser film with Erin Gray and Gil Gerard in it.  The film looked great.\n\nBut, about a year ago, I heard a story that Gerard was very disappointed in how things went with the company.  I guess there was some legal dispute with the owners of Buck Rogers trademarks and intellectual property rights.  Then, the whole thing failed to materialize.\n\nGerard and Gray still show up at the com's.  So, someone asked them about it and posted on some bulletin boards that the project was dead.  Yet, another disappointment.\n\nI also noticed that the NBC show was under the control of Glen Larson and made at Universal studios, which is the reason that so many of the Battlestar Galactica and Buck Rogers props look the same.  Probably about 30 years ago, they actually had Universal Studios tours experiences where you could sit in the cockpit and put on the helmet.  As a child, I got to sit in the Viper cockpit and put on the helmet.  They had the joystick in the cockpit and it was just like in the original BSG with the three buttons and trigger.\n\nThe Universal tour also included props and matte paintings of New Chicago used in several sequences.\n\nAt one point I even found a website where an author was finding similar props and models in both shows.  It was a neat website by a guy who had spent much time hunting for these things in both shows.  The guy must have a photographic memory because you would need to have such a memory to see these same objects in both series. \n\nAll this to say that you are correct.  The Universal people had tons of props and had the capability to produce good sci-fi.  But, in the last 30 years, the studio execs have destroyed those props and gotten rid of the production capability.\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh6e", "qSentId": 22965, "question": "Friday Night Lights is a wonderful TV show that has some absurdly idiotic second season subplots (including MURDER).

With The Room, it was at least possible that the actors were, at least at the start, trying for something decent, which led to a weird kind of resigned, tired feel to the acting in the film - as if the actors had gone on board as a serious project, and just been worn down by the farce of production. I haven't watched The Neighbours yet, but I can't imagine the actors going into this were unaware of Tommy Wiseau, and, were I in that stuation, as (I assume) a cheap actor, I'd definitely try and play up the 'bad movie/TV' factor, for a shot of being in something *as* legendarily bad as The Room. And I don't think it's something that could be helped, I don't think anything Wiseau does now would attract any actors except those that want to take part in a 'so bad it's good' project, and that kind of misses what made The Room 'so bad it's good', rather than just bad.\n\n\n\n   Did... that make a whole lot of sense?", "aSentId": 23286, "answer": "Much like Wiseau \"trying\" to make a bad show is -literally impossible- because he's not competent to even understand what that entails.
