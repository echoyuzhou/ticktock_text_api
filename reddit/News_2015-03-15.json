I feel I may be able to provide a least a *little* insight.\n\n\nThere are various programs schools use, but since I've only used one, I can only speak to Aeries SIS. Basically, this program is used by counselors and administrators mostly to keep track/data on every student within a school. It tracks things such as: attendance, grades, disciplinary actions, medical issues, address, phone number, parent contact info, a \"general log\" where educators can quickly jot down whatever was discussed whenever they speak with the student, and many other things (which aren't used very often).\n\n\nAs long as educators are using the system, most students I've worked with in high school typically have a record that goes back to middle school, mostly related to grades, disciplinary issues, and the \"general log\". The way that I've been taught to utilize the documentation portion of this program is to always respect the confidentiality of the student and what you discuss. Because of this, I have learned to write my discussions in a somewhat rudimentary code. I'll go into the log and write something like this:\n\nD bio A eng &gt; PRT\n\n\nMeaning: Dropped Biology, Added English, because of a Personal Reason relating to the Teacher\n\n\nAnother example is:\n\nPI &gt; BF grades, attn\n\nMeaning: Personal Issue relating to their boyfriend and now grades and attendance are suffering\n\n\nThis is enough for me to recall what we were talking about, but not quite legible enough for an \"outsider\" to understand if they were to look at it. Furthermore, if I were to ever be subpoenaed, I would have/provide the records, but could just say \"I don't recall what we discussed\" and not break my confidentiality with my student.\n\n\nI can say with almost 100% certainty, high schools don't provide the above info to colleges unless students request them to. Every college requires the student to send an official college transcript, and even then, the student has to request it from the school and sign that they understand what they are requesting (which is always the transcript, never with disciplinary issues on it).", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 11313, "question": "I once got sent to the principals office because someone asked me what porn was and I explained it to him.

It goes like this:\n\n* Judges have leeway in how they assign sentences, and apply it however they see fit.\n\n* Either a) some jerk judge uses that to let someone off lightly who is clearly guilty, or b) some honest judge applies the law in a sensible, yet unpopular way, and suddenly people start clamoring for mandatory sentences, zero tolerance, and other ways to stop \"activist judges\" from subverting rule of law.\n\n* New laws show up that remove judge's leeway, and require them to just assign punishment X for crime Y, no exceptions.\n\n* Lives get wrecked because the law technically covers a situation that it clearly wasn't intended to cover, and because the law offers no leeway in sentencing, the judge has to carry it out, even if they know it's bunk.\n\n* The law stays on the books for a very long time, because unless you have a high-profile case where it obviously went horribly wrong, it's really difficult for a politician/schoolboard member to stand up and say \"Ok, here's what I think we should do - lower the minimum sentence on sex offenders.\"\n\nYou can safely replace \"Judge\" with \"Administrator\" and \"Law\" with \"School District Rule\", and it's pretty much the same deal.

At least, I'm likening it to commission because that tends to be what bonuses are: a bonus sum of money given to employees based off the profit earned. \n\nOtherwise, you're just cannibalizing your bank's available funds for the sake of giving a payment for more than what they've made. This would mean that you're taking money from your clients and that money is no longer available for them because it's with you. You take in a revenue of $100; external costs render it a profit of $10; where does it make sense to pay a bonus off that of $20? That's taking a net gain and turning it into a loss for the sake of compensation based off gross.\n\nThere's always externalities in the cost of doing business and that cost normally ends up being against the employee's compensation. Otherwise, the business just fails....or in the case of banks, needs to be bailed out yet again and it then becomes a massive concern for inflation.\n\n&gt; The market of bankers versus those with the potential to do their jobs determines how much bonuses need to be in order to retain talent versus how replaceable talent is.\n\nYes, this is a basic version of the law of commodities. However, this is used to determine base salary, not to determine bonuses. At least, everywhere else it's used to determine salary/compensation rather than bonuses. You really haven't shown why this should be treated differently.\n\n&gt; Revenue from investment banking operations to determine the bonus pool makes the bonus for investment bankers tied to the revenue they bring in, which seems to make sense.\n\nExcept revenue is not the end sum. See back to the part where I reference cannibalizing the bank's available funds. If I sell $1mil worth of any product then my commission isn't based off the raw $1mil number but based off the profit margins within those transactions.

Thank you.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 12845, "question": "&gt;The first three statements lead to the conclusion that profits are a bad metric for judging bonuses because employees aren't responsible for expenses, and thus their performance isn't well correlated with profits.\n\nEmployees have to conduct their business with those expenses in mind, just like any other commission based business. At least, I'm likening it to commission because that tends to be what bonuses are: a bonus sum of money given to employees based off the profit earned. \n\nOtherwise, you're just cannibalizing your bank's available funds for the sake of giving a payment for more than what they've made. This would mean that you're taking money from your clients and that money is no longer available for them because it's with you. You take in a revenue of $100; external costs render it a profit of $10; where does it make sense to pay a bonus off that of $20? That's taking a net gain and turning it into a loss for the sake of compensation based off gross.\n\nThere's always externalities in the cost of doing business and that cost normally ends up being against the employee's compensation. Otherwise, the business just fails....or in the case of banks, needs to be bailed out yet again and it then becomes a massive concern for inflation.\n\n&gt; The market of bankers versus those with the potential to do their jobs determines how much bonuses need to be in order to retain talent versus how replaceable talent is.\n\nYes, this is a basic version of the law of commodities. However, this is used to determine base salary, not to determine bonuses. At least, everywhere else it's used to determine salary/compensation rather than bonuses. You really haven't shown why this should be treated differently.\n\n&gt; Revenue from investment banking operations to determine the bonus pool makes the bonus for investment bankers tied to the revenue they bring in, which seems to make sense.\n\nExcept revenue is not the end sum. See back to the part where I reference cannibalizing the bank's available funds. If I sell $1mil worth of any product then my commission isn't based off the raw $1mil number but based off the profit margins within those transactions. Otherwise, the business ends up losing money and eventually going broke. You can't forever operate at a loss without having to subsidize those losses somewhere. In this case, the only places where I could see a subsidy for that loss is either through more bailouts or through eating into your investors' money without directly charging them such a fee.\n\nPlease try to better explain the tying to revenue rather than profit. Thank you.", "aSentId": 12846, "answer": "You make fair points. In actuality, my position on bonuses is that they should be determined at whatever level is best for retaining talent and gaining new talent versus the cost of paying out those bonuses, and I think the best way of determining that is for an individual bank to look at what their competitors are offering, and for the banking industry as a whole to look at what competitive pressures on the labor market versus the revenue and profits generated to see what is best for keeping talent within the banking industry/draw new talent out of other industries and colleges/universities, as well as motivating employees. But this is all much too complicated for a simplistic media analysis.\n\nI do agree that sometimes bonuses are benchmarked to net profits; I generally disagree except when profits are extremely low and salaries and bonuses are a constraint on future profits. Presumably if the bank can't pay bonuses, they shouldn't, but if they can pay, the size of bonuses should be tied to what is in the control of employees, and that is the revenue side rather than the expenses side, generally.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 12809, "question": "Bonuses are based on what the employees would command on the market. If a bank offered lower bonuses than the other banks, other banks could grab a lot more of the talent from the first bank.\n\nMeanwhile, profits have suffered significantly largely due to significant regulatory requirements that reduce profits (large amounts of administrative requirements; leverage restrictions; capital requirements). They've also suffered from ultra low interest rates. And they've suffered from huge fines imposed by the SEC and other regulatory bodies. That's not to say these things are necessarily bad, it's just to say that bankers have no control over these things that are cutting out profits.\n\nIt's weird that the media is juxtaposing bonuses and profits. It should be focusing on revenue, because I suspect most of the hit on profits has been due to external factors increasing expenses and investment bankers only really control revenue, not expenses.\n\nEdit: I find it strange that my, I believe, rational critique of the methodology the media is employing to analyze bankers' bonuses is basically flat, while /u/ffxivfunk is getting massively upvoted for responding \"yeah... But fuck those guys\" as if he contributed to this conversation in literally any plausible way. He said absolutely nothing relevant to what I said, as I'm not asking for sympathy for bankers, merely rationality and logic when looking at what's going on. The investment bankers employed don't control expenses; expenses are a part of profit; therefore profit is a bad metric for analyzing whether they should get bonuses.

It reminds me a lot of the competition that was going on for CFO's and CEO's, even after the same CFO's and CEO's that kept getting passed around were people who were running companies into the ground, committing incredible amounts of fraud, and then signing contracts that were tied to BS 'performance' metrics, like expense cutting, that ended up forcing the company to provide bonuses after the company had lost 10,000 jobs and had a massive drop in share price.\n\nThe people at the top of these companies are HUGELY over-valued, they are not worth a fraction of what companies are paying for them, but they everyone who is already a 'rich management executive' is making a killing off of a broken market, while the directors of these companies are being gullible enough to believe that *any* of these ultra-high paid employees have *any* solutions. \n\nIt's a con game and the investors and directors are too scared to call a bluff.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 12851, "question": "I hope, when everything comes crashing down, that we end up EATING these people...", "aSentId": 12852, "answer": "Yeah, I'll have to pass on that.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 12851, "question": "I hope, when everything comes crashing down, that we end up EATING these people...", "aSentId": 12854, "answer": "I always thought it would be a capital idea to outsource CEO heads to the Philippines to be shrunk for pesos on the dollar.

Have PIs tail them. Perhaps if he visits a certain person that he's not supposed to be going to (prostitute?), that person may talk if he/she is paid off (Ted Haggard got exposed when a prostitute spoke up). I don't think it's illegal to pay a secretary to leak unfavorable information under *most* circumstances (people on the inside of a weak organization can be paid to leak stuff). In some cases people don't even need to be paid because they've been wronged/slighted.\n\nOnce the NGO gets *undeniable proof* (hearsay isn't strong enough) it would keep the information hidden and safe (not exposed to the public). It would *have absolutely no value if it's prematurely revealed*. However it would NEVER try to commit any blackmail (no \"do this or else\" nonsense). It would simply reveal the information whenever the politician does something unjust *without warning*. Therefore there can be no accusation of blackmail. At the same time the politicians would realize that a pattern keeps happening. Whenever a politician does X, Y happens. Whenever he does A, B happens.\n\n&gt; Besides that, we sometimes know the dirt already. Cops, judges and politicians investigated for abuse, drugs, theft, whatever. It makes no difference, the same shit keeps happening.\n\nThe guy who rules Chechnya is in that category. People know that he has opponents whacked. That would not be \"dirt\". In his case what would be dirt is if he dressed like a woman secretly, or if the CIA paid him off. If something in one category isn't \"dirt\" find something in one category that is.\n\nThere's no such thing as a magic bullet at all, in any aspect of life. No one solution will just erase all problems. However I still believe that people need to NOT think like Dorner. They become the bad guy if they are the Dorner. But if they slowly reveal something negative about a politician, they become the good guy, the hero. They need to instead think in terms of destroying the politicians' reputations and credibilities.

If this was labelled as something less severe, consensual sex with a minor, and the punishment would be lesser, I think the judge would have no problem in finding him guilty and his biases of \"was this really rape?\" wouldn't play any role in his judging.\n\nI hope you at least understand my point, even if you don't agree with it.\n\nEdit: added the part in the parenthesis's.", "aSentId": 14531, "answer": "She was homeless, hungry, and thirsty.

", "aSentId": 14533, "answer": "Look, this seems like a very complicated case, do I believe the man acted illegally and also morally wrong? Yes. Would I call it and equate it to rape. With current information, no. Do we already have a better term for what he did? We don't (or at least I'm not privy to it, neither seems the judge) and that's where the problem lies and should be fixed asap.\n\nI can't find any credible source for this story and only way how I would agree with you, that it was coerced, would be if he offered her alcohol and got her drunk. That would be coercion and rape. We don't know if that was the case, no article I read confirms it or mentions alcohol. If he only offered her to eat and to drink non-alcoholic beverages, I wouldn't classify that as coercion.\n\nLike I said, to avoid any and all confusion, this field of law should be split into plenty of subsets differentiating from many, many types of rape and other illegal sexual intercourse. There are so many of them that I really won't even go into it, all I will say is that we can't just simply equate them all to: \"rape\", or \"statutory rape\" for intercourse with a minor. Chucking it all into the same bucket does no one any justice, least of all the victims.\n\nIf there was an already established legal punishment for the wrong sexual act this guy committed I think the judge wouldn't think twice to sentence him to it. The punishment would be less severe than that for \"statutory rape\", which isn't even a legal term in many laws and is described as \"child rape\" in some cases, which furthers how badly this issue is transcribed into law. The situation the man caused really doesn't fit the term \"child rape\", I think that's the reason why the judges have such a hard time sentencing anyone. With better legal terminology and more diverse punishments anyone would receive what they're due and not just walk away. But that's just my opinion.\n\nIn short the judge simply couldn't have made the right decision with current legislative in many countries. You sentence someone for a similar act and say it was rape, it seems too harsh, you let him walk it's really unfair to the victim.

And sure, we can try to correct strong socioeconomic imbalances, that's fine.\n\nThe problem with things like affirmative action is that it discriminates based on race. You might think that affirmative action makes you equal to a wealthy white guy, but think of white people who live in poverty for a second. To them, affirmative action is giving you a privilege over them.\n\nYou're both poor, but the government gives you some help that they do not get, because you were born black/your ancestor was a slave, and they're white/their ancestors were just poor.\n\nAnd not only are you given help that white people in poverty aren't given (which is unfair already), but that help comes at *their* expense, because when you get hired due to affirmative action (instead of your qualifications) it means a white person, better qualified than you, was rejected for the job.\n\nAnd I really want to point out that it is indeed people who come from poverty that you are competing with, with affirmative action. Affirmative action will never help you get top-level jobs that pay well, it will not help you compete against rich white kids who went to Harvard. Affirmative action will only help you compete and screw over other people who just like you,were born in poverty, except that they're white.\n\nAgain, it's one thing to try to fix socioeconomic unfairness, but solutions that are based on race are not the way to go.
