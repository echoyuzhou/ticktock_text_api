In Vulkan not only is all the easy-to-use stuff gone, you also have a lot more low level stuff to twiddle with.

It doesn't defeat the purpose of vulkan, if anything it exemplifies the power of what vulkan can allow us to do.\n\n&gt; why do you need new high level graphics APIs when GL and DX are both very mature?\n\nMaturity is good, but it has its drawbacks.  OpenGL is somewhat of a clunky API.  It has random state, contexts, and variable support from one card to the next.  As well, the support for multithreading is pathetically bad.\n\nDirectX (I haven't dealt as much with it) is microsoft only.  While it does a better job of documenting and concertizing the API, it doesn't help if you are trying to target android, linux, or macs.  On top of that, you are somewhat bound to whatever version of directx the card supports.  That forces you do do some fun stuff where you either have to say \"No, I don't support this\" or \"I hope emulation is good enough\" or \"Lets write this in DX12, DX11, DX10, and DX9\".\n\nEven for opengl and directx, moving the high level interaction out of the graphics card driver and into user space libraries will be a godsend.  Assuming vulkan and SPIR stay significantly low level and unchanging it means that now you can use opengl version \"whatever\" and distribute that with your application.  You no longer have to worry about whether or not the graphics card supports the version of opengl you are targeting because you are distributing it with your executable.\n\nNow, my hunch is that many of these game companies are going to say something to the effect of \"I like these things about opengl, these things about dx, and I really wish I could do X with opengl and dx\".

I like Haskell, I do some hobby programming in Haskell, but *it needs to be put down a peg*.\n\n&gt;As it turns out, there are few less qualified to teach others about a technology than one who has not experienced its implications. For an incredibly deep and thoughtful language like Haskell, this take a long, long time.\n\nI fall in that category myself. I've been learning Haskell and coding in it for *three years*, and I still don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I do know that I'm marginally more experienced than the average Haskell proselyte, and that if I'm in no position to be advocating it, then *they aren't either*.\n\nThe worst part is, I find Haskell positively wonderful, yet I find myself *constantly bashing it* online and elsewhere, because the Haskell crowd is failing really hard at managing non-Haskellers' expectations. It's probably not easier or simpler or more effective than your favorite language; learning curve-wise, it's more akin to an aggressively experimental C++.\n\nIt's got its fair share of poor design decisions, of accumulated cruft, of caveats. It has shit for tools, dependency management is the tenth circle of hell, and the documentation is disorganized, condescending, and/or undecipherable to anyone without a serious background in abstract mathematics.\n\nHaskell is a total fucking shit show. How could it *not* be, when that is also the case of *every single commercially successful language*? \n\nPeople need to be reminded that Haskell is not the second coming of Jesus Christ; what it is is a better-than-average programming platform for the math-inclined.

But to really squeeze every drop of performance you're going to be using lots of GHC pragams, looking at the core, using unboxed types, doing loop fusions, writing GHC rewrite rules. Basically, all a long way from Learn You a Haskell. Compare to C where I feel like I at least have a better mental model of where all the bytes are going.\n\n&gt; When does :info symbol not work for this?\n\nYes, but only if the module has no type errors, otherwise you can't load it with ghci until you fix them or comment them out. Ghci also won't help you if you're browsing code on github or something. \n\nAdmittedly, this is a deficiency of many languages. The counter example is Java where you can almost always find the origin package of a symbol just by looking at the code (so long as no static imports have been used).
